# Freebox Binding

This binding integrates the [Freebox Revolution](https://www.free.fr/freebox/freebox-revolution/) and [Freebox Delta](https://www.free.fr/freebox/freebox-delta/) to your openHAB installation.

The server can be connected to Free infrastructures either by xDSL or fiber optic.

## Supported Things

This binding supports the following thing types:

| Thing      | Thing Type | Description                                           |
|------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| repeater   | Thing      | A Free wifi repeater.                                 |

## Discovery

The API bridge is discovered automatically through mDNS in the local network.
After the bridge is discovered and available to openHAB, the binding will automatically discover phone, network devices available on the local network.
Note that the discovered thing will be setup to use only HTTP API (and not HTTPS) because only an IP can be automatically determined while a domain name is required to use HTTPS with a valid certificate.

## Binding configuration

The binding itself is not configurable.

If the parameter *api_domain* is not set, the binding will use the default address used by Free to access your Freebox Server (mafreebox.freebox.fr).
The bridge thing will initialize only if a valid application token (parameter *appToken*) is filled.

## Authentication

You will have to authorize openHAB to connect to your Freebox. Here is the process described :

**Step 1** At binding startup, if no token is recorded in the Freebox Server (bridge) configuration, the binding will run a pairing request

**Step 2** Run to your Freebox and approve the pairing request for openHAB Freebox Binding that is displayed on the Freebox screen

**Step 3** the application token is automatically recorded in the Freebox Server (bridge) configuration

**Step 4** you can use the console command `freeboxos apptoken` to display the application token and use it later to set up your thing in a configuration file

**Optionally** you can log in your Freebox admin console to allocate needed rights to openHAB

Once initialized, the thing will generate all available channels.
