	<name>Wunderground Update Receiver Binding</name>
	<description><![CDATA[
		<p>
		This binding enables acting as a receiver of updates from weather stations that post measurements
		to https://rtupdate.wunderground.com/weatherstation/updateweatherstation.php. If the hostname is configurable - as on
		weather stations based on the Fine Offset Electronics WH2600-IP - this is simple, otherwise you have to set up dns
		such that it resolves the above hostname to your server, without preventing the server from resolving the proper ip if
		you want to forward the request.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you wish to pass the measurements on to rtupdate.wunderground.com, you can use a simple rule that triggers on the
		wundergroundupdatereceiver:wundergroundUpdateReceiver:&lt;channel-id&gt;:metadata#last-query-trigger running the
		following simple dsl:
		</p>

		<p>
		<code>
		val requestQuery = receivedEvent
		sendHttpGetRequest("https://rtupdate.wunderground.com/weatherstation/updateweatherstation.php?" + requestQuery)
		</code>
		</p>

		<p>
		You can also submit the measurements to other services such as OpenWeatherMap by constructing an HTTP request in a rule.
