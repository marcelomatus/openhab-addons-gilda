# Shelly Binding

This Binding implements control for the Shelly series of devices.
This supports sending commands to the devices as well as reading device status and sensor data.

## Firmware

To utilize all features the binding requires firmware version 1.5.2 or newer.
This should be available for all devices.
Older versions work in general, but have impacts to functionality (e.g. no events for battery powered devices).

The binding displays a WARNING if the firmware is older.
It also informs you when an update is available.
Use the device's web ui or the Shelly App to perform the update.

## Discovery

The binding uses mDNS to discovery the Shelly devices.
They periodically announce their presence, which can be used by the binding to find them on the local network and fetch their IP address.
The binding will then use the Shelly REST API (HTTP) to discover device capabilities, read status and control the device.
In addition event callbacks will be used to support battery powered devices.

Make sure to wake-up battery powered devices (press the button inside the device) so they show up on the network.
Sometime you need to run the manual discovery multiple times until you see all your devices.

Important: The IP address shouldn't change after the device is added as a new thing in openHAB.
This could be achieved by

- assigning a static IP address or
- use DHCP and setup the router to assign always the same ip address to the device

### Password protected devices

The Shelly Apps allow to protect device configuration by user id+password, which is  supported by the binding.
If you are using password protected  devices you need to configure user id and password. 
A special thing is created if the access to the device's APU cannot be initialized.
You need to edit the Thing configuration and setup user id and password (same as in the Shelly App) to activate this Thing.
The Thing will be re-initialized and the Thing type adjusted and this was successful.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has some global configuration options.

| Parameter      |Description                                                       |Mandatory|Default                                         |

| defaultPassword|Default password for HTTP authentication when not set in the Thing|    no   |admin                                           |

## Thing Configuration

|Parameter         |Description                                                   |Mandatory|Default                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
|deviceIp          |IP address of the Shelly device                               |    yes  |none                                              |
|userId            |The user id used for HTTP authentication                      |    no   |none                                              |
|password          |Password for HTTP authentication*                             |    no   |none                                              |
|lowBattery        |Threshold for battery level. Set alert when level is below.   |    no   |20 (=20%), only for battery powered devices       |
|updateInterval    |Interval for the background status check in seconds.          |    no   |1h for battery powered devices, 60s for all others|
|eventsButton      |true: register event "trigger when a button is pushed"        |    no   |false                                             |
|eventsPush        |true: register event "trigger on short and long push"         |    no   |false                                             |
|eventsSwitch      |true: register event "trigger of switching the relay output"  |    no   |true                                              |
|eventsSensorReport|true: register event "posted updated sensor data"             |    no   |true for sensor devices                           |
|eventsCoIoT       |true: Listen for CoIoT/COAP events                            |    no   |true for battery devices, false for others        |

Independent from the updateInterval setting the binding will perform a settings refresh from the device once per minute.
There is no event from the device that the settings have be changed by the Shelly App so this is kind of a fallback to get updates at least once per minute. 



## Channels

### General Notes

- Various channels are only visible for linking when you click Show More in the channel definition
- input channel is only available with firmware > 1.5.6, otherwise NULL
- use channel rollerpos only if you need the inverted value, otherwise use the control channel and Item Type Number, see example
- Short push and long push events require firmware version 1.5.6+.
- The different devices have different types of power meters = different set of channels.

Every device has a channel group "device" with the following channels:

|Group     |Channel      |Type     |read-only|Desciption                                                                       |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|device    |uptime       |Number   |yes      |Number of seconds since the device was powered up                                |
|          |lastUpdate   |DateTime |yes      |Timestamp of last update on any of the device's channel                          |
|          |signal       |Number   |yes      |WiFi signal strength (RSSI)                                                      |
|          |lastAlarm    |String   |yes      |Most recent alarm for health check                                               |



### Event Channel

The binding maps the inbound http events into trigger events when enabled in the Thing Configuration

|Event Type|Description|
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|BTN_ON    |The Button was pressed                                                                                             |
|BTN_OFF   |The Button was released                                                                                            |
|SHORTPUSH |A short push to the button was detected  (requires FW 1.5.6)                                                       |
|SHORTPUSH |A long push to the button was detected   (requires FW 1.5.6)                                                       |
|OUT_ON    |Relais output is on                                                                                                |
|OUT_OFF   |Relais output is off                                                                                               |

The channel is implemented as a Trigger and could be used in a Rule:
```
rule "Shelly Events"
when
    Channel "shelly:shelly2-relay:XXXXXX:device#event" triggered
then
    logInfo("Shelly", "A Shelly device event was triggered, payload="+receivedEvent.toString())
end
```

See Rule examples for information how to process the event payload.

### Alarm Events

The binding does some health checking on the device

- The RSSI signal is monitored every 10 minutes. A alarm is send to the event channel when RSSI is < -80, which indicates an instable connection.
- An alarm is send to the event channel when over heating, overload or a load error is reported by the device

Those alarms could be received through the event channel as a trigger.

### Shelly 2.5 - roller mode (thing-type: shelly25-roller)

The Shelly 2.5 includes 2 meters, one for each channel.
However, it doesn't make sense to differ power consumption for the roller moving up vs. moving down.
For this the binding aggregates the power consumption of both relays and includes the values in "meter1".

Please note that the settings of channel group color are only valid in color mode and vice versa for white mode.
The current firmware doesn't support the timestamp report for the meters.
In this case "n/a" is returned.
Maybe an upcoming firmware release adds this attribute, then the correct value is returned;
