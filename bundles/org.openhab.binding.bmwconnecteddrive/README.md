# BMW ConnectedDrive Binding

<img align="right" src="./doc/bmw-connected.png" width="150" height="150"/>

The Binding provides a Connection between [BMWs ConnectedDrive Portal](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/country-region-select/country-region-selection.html) and openHAB.
All Vehicles connected to an Account will be detected by the Discovery with the correct type 

* Conventional Fuel Vehicle
* Plugin-Hybrid Electrical Vehicle 
* Battery Electric Vehicle with Range Extender
* Battery Electric Vehicle 

In addition Properties are attached with Information and Services provided by this Vehicle.
The provided data depends on 

1. the [Type](#Things) and 
2. the Services mentioned in [Properties](#properties)

Different Channel Groups are clustering all informations.
Check for each Group if it's supported for this Vehicle.

Please note **this isn't a real-time Binding**. 
If the Door is opened the state isn't transmitted and changed immediately. 
This isn't a flaw in the Binding itself because the state in BMWs own ConnectedDrive App is also updated with some delay. 

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The Bridge establishes the Connection between BMW ConnectedDrive Portal and openHAB.

### Things

Four different Vehicle Types are provided. 
They differ in the supported Channel Groups & Channels. 
Conventional Fuel Vehicles have no _Charging Profile_, Electric Vehicles don't provide a _Fuel Range_. 
For Hybrid Vehicles in addition to _Fuel and Electric Range_ the _Hybrid Range_ is shown.

#### Properties

<img align="right" src="./doc/properties.png" width="500" height="600"/>

For each Vehicle Properties are available. 
Basically 3 Types of Information are registered as Properties

* Informations regarding your Dealer with Address and Phone Number
* Which services are available / not available
* Vehicle Properties like Color, Model Type, Drive Train and Construction Year

In the right picture  can see in *Services Activated* e.g. the *DoorLock* and *DoorUnlock* Services are mentioned. 
This ensures [Channel Group _Remote Services_](#remote-services) is supporting Door lock and Door unlock.

In  *Services Supported* the entry *LastDestination* is mentioned.
So it's valid to connect Channel Group [Last Destinations](#destinations) in order to display the last 3 Navigation Destinations.

| Property Key       | Property Value      |  Supported Channel Groups    |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Services Supported | Statistics          | last-trip, lifetime          |
| Services Supported | LastDestinations    | destinations                 |
| Services Activated | list of services    | remote                       |


## Discovery

Auto Discovery is starting after creation of the Bridge towards BMW ConnectedDrive. 
A list of your registered Vehicles is queried and all found Vehicles are added in Inbox.
Unique Identifier is the *Vehicle Identification Number* (VIN). 
If a Thing is already declared in a  *.things configuration* Discovery won't highlight it again.
Properties will be attached to predefined Vehicles if the VIN is matching.

## Configuration

## Further Descriptions

### List Interface

Currently there are 3 occurrences of dynamic data delivered as Lists

* Upcoming Services
* Check Control Messages
* Last Destinations

In order to provide all data the lists are organized the following way based on the Service Group example

* **size** is the total length of the list. Read-only.
* **index** is the current selected index starting with 0 => list with size 10, valid index is between 0 - 9. If the index is set to _out of bounds_ it's set to first element. Read-write.
* **next** declares a switch for scrolling forward through the list in an endless way. Reaching end of list will start again from 0. Read-write.
* **name**, **mileage** and **date** declares the list item. It will change when setting new index or perform next. Read-only.

### Range vs Range Radius

<img align="right" src="./doc/range-radius.png" width="400" height="350"/>

You will observe differences in the Vehicle Range and Range Radius values. 
While range is indicating the possible distance to be driven on roads the range radius indicates the reachable range on the Map.

The right picture shows the distance between Kassel and Frankfurt in Germany. 
While the Air-line Distance is ~145 Kilometer the Route Distance is ~192 Kilometer.
So Range value is the normal remaining range.
See the Section [OpenStreetMap](#openstreetMap-widget) how the Range Radius is used to indicate the reachable Range on Map.
Please note this is just an indicator and the effective range, especially for Electric Vehicles, 
depends on many factors like driving style and electric consumers. 
 
### Last Status Update Timestamp

A timestamp is showing the last Vehicle Status update. If this isn't shown correctly please check the date settings.
In case of Raspberry Pi execute *raspi-config*, select *Localization Options*, the *Change Time Zone*
Select your *Geographical Area* and afterwards the correct City.
One restart of openHAB service with *systemctl restart openhab2* is necessary in order to see the corrected Time Settings.
 
Correct TimeZone is crucial for handling all Time information in openHAB and it's discussed many times in the Forum.
See [similar discussion in the openHAB Forum](https://community.openhab.org/t/solved-wrong-local-time-how-to-change/90938) which deals with the same problem.

### TroubleShooting

BMW has a high range of Vehicles supported by BMWs ConnectedDrive.
In case of any issues with this Binding please help to resolve it! 
Please perform the following Steps:

* Can you login [into ConnectedDrive](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/country-region-select/country-region-selection.html) with your Credentials? _Please note this isn't the BMW Customer Portal - it's the ConnectedDrive Portal_
* Is the Vehicle listed in your Account? _There's a one-to-one dependency from User to Vehicle_

If the access to the Portal and listing of the Vehicle is checked some debug data is needed in order to identify the issue. 
The [Example Sitemap](#Sitemap) contains the necessary items to generate Debug Data.

#### My Vehicle isn't found automatically!

The Vehicle isn't recognized or a predefined Vehicle doesn't show the right properties?
For this the [Discovery Fingerprint](#bridge-channels) is needed.
Short press on the Switch will force some logging entries which can be [normally found in the logs here](http://openhab:9001/) 

#### My Vehicle shows wrong data or data is missing!

Now the [Vehicle Fingerprint](#troubleshooting) is needed.
Proceed like before, shortly press the Switch and the log contains the data.

Personal Data is eliminated from the log entries so it should be possible to share them in public.
Data like

* Dealer Properties
* Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
* Location Latitude / Longitude 

are anonymized.

After the corresponding Fingerprint is generated please [follow the instructions to raise an Issue](https://community.openhab.org/t/how-to-file-an-issue/68464) and attach the Fingerprint data!
Your feedback is highly appreciated!

Here an example of Debug Fingerprint Data from a BEV_REX Vehicle

## Going further

You're now able to receive the Vehicle Data in openHAB. Continue the work and combine this data with other Powerful openHAB Features, Bindings and Widgets.

### Notification

A quite handy rule if you aren't the *permanent Driver* of the Car but 're somehow responsible for it e.g for one of your family Members.
As soon as a check control message occurs a message notification is sent to the Android App.
Below the rule as an example. 
Just insert the Mail Address used for openHAB Cloud Connector.

```
// App Notification if Check Control Message is active
rule "CheckControl"
    when
        System started or
        Item i3CCCount changed 
    then
        val count = i3CCCount.state as Number
        if(count.intValue > 0) {
            sendNotification("bernd.w@ymann.de","i3 Check Control: "+i3CCName.state)
        }                                                    
end
```

Besides the CheckControl the next upcoming Service can be monitored.
The below rule checks every Monday at 9:00 o'clock if the next Service is required in the next 30 days.
Time enough to schedule a date at your favorite Garage. 

```
// Cron for Service observation
rule "Service"
    when
        System started or
        Time cron "0 0 9 ? * MON *"
    then
        val DateTime dt = new DateTime(i3ServiceDate.state.toString)
        val Number daysToService = (dt.getMillis - now.millis) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24
        if(daysToService < 30) {
            logInfo("Service Date","Time to schedule Service")
                sendNotification("YOUR_OPENHAB_EMAIL", "Service required in " + daysToService + " days")
        } else {
            logInfo("Service Date","{} days to {} Service left ",daysToService,i3ServiceName.state.toString)
        }
end
```

### OpenstreetMap Widget

<img align="right" src="./doc/panel.png" width="600" height="260"/>

The [OpenStreetMap Widget](https://community.openhab.org/t/custom-widget-map/39225) can be used to display a Map on the UI Panel.
It's configurable with *Markers* and *Accuracy Circles* which are quite handy to display several informations.
See the HABPanel example with the OpenStreetMap Widget on the right side with

* Marker of current Vehicle location as Center of the Map
* Green Circle showing Electric Range Radius
* Blue Circle showing Hybrid Range Radius
* One additional Markers for the current selected Destinations

Some small modifications are needed to get the Location values. 
The items file declares some String with Latitude, Longitude values as String used in the Markers of the Widget. 
The Range Radius is needed in Meters so a small conversion is needed.
The rules file is performing the calculations on startup and if the values are changing. 
If the location of the Vehicle changes it will be shown in the Map

#### Additional Items

```
// Range Radius Items
String          i3LatLongElectric      "Location String"
Number          i3RadiusElectricMeter  "Electric Range Radius"
String          i3LatLongHybrid        "Location String"
Number          i3RadiusHybridMeter    "Hybrid Range Radius"
//Destination Items
String          mapDestination         "Destination"
```

#### Rules

```
// Hybrid and Electric Range Radius plus Vehicle Coordinates
rule "LocationRangeChange"
    when
        System started or
        Item i3Latitude changed or
            Item i3Longitude changed or
            Item i3RangeRadiusElectric changed or
        Item i3RangeRadiusHybrid changed
    then
        // Electric Range Radius & Vehicle Coordinates
        val latitudeNumber = i3Latitude.state as Number
        val longitudeNumber = i3Longitude.state as Number
        i3LatLongElectric.sendCommand(latitudeNumber.floatValue+","+longitudeNumber.floatValue)
        val radiusElectricNumber = i3RadiusElectric.state as Number
        i3RadiusElectricMeter.sendCommand(radiusElectricNumber.intValue * 1000)
        
        // Hybrid Range Radius & Vehicle Coordinates
        i3LatLongHybrid.sendCommand(latitudeNumber.floatValue +","+longitudeNumber.floatValue)
        val radiusHybridNumber = i3RadiusHybrid.state as Number
        logInfo("Rage Map","Radius Hybrid"+radiusHybridNumber.intValue)
        i3RadiusHybridMeter.sendCommand(radiusHybridNumber.intValue * 1000)    
end

// Changes Coordinates to the current selected Destination List Item
rule "Destinations"
    when
        Item i3DestIndex changed   
    then   
        val lat = i3DestLat.state as Number
        val lon = i3DestLon.state as Number
        mapDestination.sendCommand(lat.floatValue +","+lon.floatValue) 
end
```

### Status Image

<img align="right"  src="./doc/CarStatusImages.png" width="400" height="300"/>

This Rule is aimed to improve the visibility of the Vehicle Status. 
Therefore the Image is used to reflect _an overall status_ which can be identified at the first glance.
As an example the Rule is reflecting the following status as Image

* Side - Vehicle is charging
* Driver Door - Doors are not locked => execute [Remote Service](#remote-services) Lock
* Dashboard - Check Control Message is available
* Front - Vehicle is at the Home Location
* Rear - Vehicle is away from Home Location

#### Status Image Rule

```
// Change Image according to Vehicle Status
rule "Image Status"
    when
        System started or
        Item i3ChargingStatus changed or
        Item i3Latitude changed or
        Item i3Longitude changed or
        Item i3CheckControl changed or
        Item i3LockStatus changed
    then
        if(i3ChargingStatus.state.toString == "Charging") {
            logInfo("Vehicle Image","Charging")
            i3ImageViewport.sendCommand("SIDE")
        } else if(i3LockStatus.state.toString != "Secured") {
            logInfo("Vehicle Image","Doors not locked")
            i3ImageViewport.sendCommand("DRIVERDOOR")
        } else if(i3CheckControl.state.toString != "Ok") {
            logInfo("Vehicle Image","Check Control Active")
            i3ImageViewport.sendCommand("DASHBOARD")
        } else {
            val latitudeNumber = i3Latitude.state as Number
            val longitudeNumber = i3Longitude.state as Number
            // Home Location Range
            if((1.23 < latitudeNumber.floatValue) && ( latitudeNumber.floatValue < 1.24) && (3.21 < longitudeNumber.floatValue) && (longitudeNumber.floatValue < 3.22) ) {
                logInfo("Vehicle Image","Home Location")
                i3ImageViewport.sendCommand("FRONT")
            } else {
                logInfo("Vehicle Image","Vehicle is away")
                i3ImageViewport.sendCommand("REAR")
            }    
        }
end
```

This work is based on the project of [Bimmer Connected](https://github.com/bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected). 
Also a [manual installation based on python](https://community.openhab.org/t/script-to-access-the-bmw-connecteddrive-portal-via-oh/37345) was already available for openHAB.
This Binding is basically a port to openHAB based on these concept works!
