# BMW ConnectedDrive Binding

<img align="right" src="./doc/bmw-connected.png" width="150" height="150"/>

The binding provides a connection between [BMW's ConnectedDrive Portal](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/country-region-select/country-region-selection.html) and openHAB.
All vehicles connected to an account will be detected by the discovery with the correct type 

* Conventional Fuel Vehicle
* Plugin-Hybrid Electrical Vehicle 
* Battery Electric Vehicle with Range Extender
* Battery Electric Vehicle 

In addition properties are attached with information and services provided by this vehicle.
The provided data depends on 

1. the [Thing Type](#things) and 
2. the [Properties](#properties) mentioned in Services

Different channel groups are clustering all informations.
Check for each group if it's supported for this Vehicle.

Please note **this isn't a real-time binding**. 
If a door is opened the state isn't transmitted and changed immediately. 
This isn't a flaw in the binding itself because the state in BMW's own ConnectedDrive App is also updated with some delay. 

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The bridge establishes the connection between BMW's ConnectedDrive Portal and openHAB.

| Name                       | Bridge Type ID | Description                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| BMW ConnectedDrive Account | account        | Access to BMW ConnectedDrive Portal for a specific user    |


### Things

Four different vehicle types are provided. 
They differ in the supported channel groups & channels. 
Conventional Fuel Vehicles have no _Charging Profile_, Electric Vehicles don't provide a _Fuel Range_. 
For hybrid vehicles in addition to _Fuel and Electric Range_ the _Hybrid Range_ is shown.
 
| Name                                | Thing Type ID | Supported Channel Groups                               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| BMW Electric Vehicle                | bev           | status, range, location, service, check, charge, image |
| BMW Electric Vehicle with REX       | bev_rex       | status, range, location, service, check, charge, image |

| BMW Conventional Vehicle            | conv          | status, range, location, service, check, image         |

 
#### Properties

<img align="right" src="./doc/properties.png" width="500" height="600"/>

For each vehicle properties are available. 
Basically 3 types of information are registered as properties

* Informations regarding your dealer with address and phone number
* Which services are available / not available
* Vehicle properties like color, model type, drive train and construction year

In the right picture can see in *Services Activated* e.g. the *DoorLock* and *DoorUnlock* services are mentioned. 
This ensures channel group [Remote Services](#remote-services) is supporting door lock and unlock remote control.

In  *Services Supported* the entry *LastDestination* is mentioned.
So it's valid to connect channel group [Last Destinations](#destinations) in order to display and select the last navigation destinations.

| Property Key       | Property Value      |  Supported Channel Groups    |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| servicesSupported  | Statistics          | last-trip, lifetime          |
| servicesSupported  | LastDestinations    | destinations                 |
| servicesActivated  | _list of services_  | remote                       |


## Discovery

Auto discovery is starting after the bridge towards BMW's ConnectedDrive is created. 
A list of your registered vehicles is queried and all found things are added in the inbox.
Unique identifier is the *Vehicle Identification Number* (VIN). 
If a thing is already declared in a  _.things_ configuration, discovery won't highlight it again.
Properties will be attached to predefined vehicles if the VIN is matching.

## Configuration

### Bridge Configuration

## Further Descriptions

### Dynamic Data

<img align="right" src="./doc/ServiceOptions.png" width="400" height="350"/>

There are 3 occurrences of dynamic data delivered

* Upcoming Services delivered in group [Services](#services)
* Check Control Messages delivered in group [Check Control](#check-control)
* Last Destinations delivered in group [Destinations](#destinations)

The channel id _name_ shows the first element as default. 
All other possibilities are attached as options. 
The picture on the right shows the _Service Name_ item and all four possible options. 
Select the desired service and the corresponding _Service Date & Milage_ will be shown.  

### TroubleShooting

BMW has a high range of vehicles supported by ConnectedDrive.
In case of any issues with this binding help to resolve it! 
Please perform the following steps:

* Can you [log into ConnectedDrive](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/country-region-select/country-region-selection.html) with your credentials? Please note this isn't the BMW Customer portal - it's the ConnectedDrive portal
* Is the vehicle listed in your account? There's a one-to-one relation from user to vehicle

If the access to the portal is working and the vehicle is listed some debug data is needed in order to identify the issue. 

#### Generate Debug Fingerprint

If you checked the above pre-conditions you need to get the debug fingerprint from the logs.
First [enable debug logging](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/logging.html#defining-what-to-log) for the binding.

```
log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.bmwconnecteddrive
```

The debug fingerprint is generated immediately after the vehicle thing is initialized the first time, e.g. after openHAB startup. 
To force a new fingerprint disable the thing shortly and enable it again. 
Personal data is eliminated from the log entries so it should be possible to share them in public.
Data like

* Dealer Properties
* Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
* Location latitude / longitude 

are anonymized.
You'll find the fingerprint in the logs with the command

```
grep "BMW ConnectedDrive Binding" openhab.log
```

After the corresponding fingerprint is generated please [follow the instructions to raise an issue](https://community.openhab.org/t/how-to-file-an-issue/68464) and attach the fingerprint data!
Your feedback is highly appreciated!


### Range vs Range Radius

<img align="right" src="./doc/range-radius.png" width="400" height="350"/>

You will observe differences in the vehicle range and range radius values. 
While range is indicating the possible distance to be driven on roads the range radius indicates the reachable range on the map.

The right picture shows the distance between Kassel and Frankfurt in Germany. 
While the air-line distance is ~145 kilometer the route distance is ~192 kilometer.
So range value is the normal remaining range while the range radius values can be used e.g. on [Mapview](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/sitemaps.html#element-type-mapview) to indicate the reachable range on map.
Please note this is just an indicator of the effective range.
Especially for electric vehicles it depends on many factors like driving style and usage of electric consumers. 

## Full Example

The example is based on a BMW i3 with range extender (REX). 
Exchange the three configuration parameters in the Things section

* YOUR_USERNAME - with your ConnectedDrive login username
* YOUR_PASSWORD - with your ConnectedDrive password credentials
* VEHICLE_VIN - the vehicle identification number

In addition search for all occurrences of *i3* and replace it with your Vehicle Identification like *x3* or *535d* and you're ready to go!

## Credits

This work is based on the project of [Bimmer Connected](https://github.com/bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected). 
Also a [manual installation based on python](https://community.openhab.org/t/script-to-access-the-bmw-connecteddrive-portal-via-oh/37345) was already available for openHAB.
This binding is basically a port to openHAB based on these concept works!
