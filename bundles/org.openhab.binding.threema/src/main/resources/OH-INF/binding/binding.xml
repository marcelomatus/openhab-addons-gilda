	<description><![CDATA[This is the binding allows to send text messages via the Threema.Gateway (https://gateway.threema.ch).<br />
		<p>There are two main modes of operation:
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>
				Basic mode (server-based encryption)
				<ul>
					<li>The server handles all encryption for you.</li>
					<li>The server needs to know the private key associated with your Threema API identity.</li>
					<li>Incoming messages and delivery receipts are not supported.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>End-to-end encrypted mode (yet not supported by this binding)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The server doesn't know your private key.</li>
					<li>Incoming messages and delivery receipts are supported.</li>
					<li>You need to run software on your side to encrypt each message
						before it can be sent, and to decrypt any incoming
						messages or delivery receipts.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
