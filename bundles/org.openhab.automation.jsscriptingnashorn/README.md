# JavaScript Scripting (Nashorn)

This add-on allows you to use your older JavaScript (ECMAScript 5.1) rules on newer Java versions until they are migrated to JavaScript (ECMAScript 2021+).

The add-on uses a standalone [Nashorn Engine](https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn) which was part of Java until it was removed in Java 15.
