# LiquidCheck Binding

This binding is for the Liquid-Check device from SI-Elektronik GmbH.
Which can be used to measure level and content of tanks.

## Supported Things

- `liquidCheckDevice`: The Liquid-Check device in Hardwareversion B and Firmwareversion 1.60 has been tested and is working. You can access the measured data, raw data, the settings as properties and command a measurement. `liquidCheckDevice`

## Discovery

This binding discovers the devices via a ping and request method. It uses every ethernet/wlan interface that is connected to the openHAB server.
Therefore it will only start a discovery once a hour.

## Binding Configuration

There is no configuration needed.

## Thing Configuration

You only need to add the IP address of the device or use the auto discovery method.
