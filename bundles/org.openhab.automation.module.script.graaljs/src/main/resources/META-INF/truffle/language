# This is included as a merged version of the languages files for the two truffle languages required: regex & js. The
# truffle runtime will attempt to load these however if we repack the jars into the OSGi bundle then we will only retain
# the last one. A possible better solution would be to include the language jars in META-INF/lib and add them to the
# Bundle-Classpath, or ideally include them as their own bundles (although this is untested). Either way, this problem
# is moot with JDK11 as this will all be present in the system classloader anyway.
