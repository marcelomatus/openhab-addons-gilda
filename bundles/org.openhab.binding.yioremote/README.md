# YIOremote Binding

This binding will control a YIO Dock/Remote combination. YIO Remote/Dock is a smart home solution that includes an IP based remote. More information can be found at [yio-remote.com](https://www.yio-remote.com/) or in the forums at [community.yio-remote] (https://community.yio-remote.com/). 

This binding has been designed to compliment the YIO websocket Transport Protocol.

Since this binding allows actual you to trigger IR send/receive actions on YIO Dock, this allows you to use the YIO Dock as an IR solution to openHAB and even learn new IR codes from your remotes. In other words, if the IR code is known then openHAB can use the YIO Dock to control that Device regardless if there is an openHAB binding for it or not.

## Supported Things

_Please describe the different supported things / devices within this section._
_Which different types are supported, which models were tested etc.?_
_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Discovery

_Describe the available auto-discovery features here. Mention for what it works and what needs to be kept in mind when using it._

## Binding Configuration

_If your binding requires or supports general configuration settings, please create a folder ```cfg``` and place the configuration file ```<bindingId>.cfg``` inside it. In this section, you should link to this file and provide some information about the options. The file could e.g. look like:_

```
# Configuration for the Philips Hue Binding
#
# Default secret key for the pairing of the Philips Hue Bridge.
# It has to be between 10-40 (alphanumeric) characters
# This may be changed by the user for security reasons.
secret=openHABSecret
```

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the information that is available within ```src/main/resources/ESH-INF/binding``` of your binding._

_If your binding does not offer any generic configurations, you can remove this section completely._

## Thing Configuration

_Describe what is needed to manually configure a thing, either through the (Paper) UI or via a thing-file. This should be mainly about its mandatory and optional configuration parameters. A short example entry for a thing file can help!_

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Channels

_Here you should provide information about available channel types, what their meaning is and how they can be used._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

| channel  | type   | description                  |
|----------|--------|------------------------------|
| control  | Switch | This is the control channel  |

## Full Example

_Provide a full usage example based on textual configuration files (*.things, *.items, *.sitemap)._

## Any custom content here!

_Feel free to add additional sections for whatever you think should also be mentioned about your binding!_
