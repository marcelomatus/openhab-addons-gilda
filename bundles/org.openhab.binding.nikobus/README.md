# Nikobus Binding

Binding allows openHAB to interact with the Nikobus home automation system.

It's based on it's [v1 counterpart](https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/tree/master/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.nikobus) made by Davy Vanherbergen.

[![Demo Video Nikobus](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QiNb-8QxXpo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNb-8QxXpo)

More specifically, it allows openHAB to:

* send (simulated) button presses to the Nikobus,
* react to button presses which occur on the Nikobus,
* change the status of switch channels on a Nikobus switch module,
* request the status of switch channels on a Nikobus switch module,
* change the status of dimmer channels on a Nikobus dimmer module,
* request the status of dimmer channels on a Nikobus dimmer module,
* send commands to the Nikobus roller shutter module.

This binding works with at least the following hardware:

* PC-link module (05-200),
* Push buttons (05-060-01, 05-064-01), RF Transmitter (05-314), PIR Sensor (430-00500),
* 4 channel switch module (05-002-02),
* 12 channel switch module (05-000-02),
* 12 channel dimmer module.

## Supported Things

Binding supports a serial connection via `nikobus:pc-link` bridge to the Nikobus installation (PC-Link module):

Bridge enables communication with other Nikobus components:

* `switch-module` - Nikobus switch module, i.e. `05-000-02`,
* `dimmer-module` - Nikobus dim-controller module, i.e. `05-007-02`,
* `rollershutter-module` - Nikobus roller shutter module,
* `push-button` - Nikobus physical push button.

## Discovery

In order to configure items in openHAB, one first needs to know the addresses of switch-modules, dimmer-modules, rollershutter-modules and push-buttons.

Binding's root logger is `org.openhab.binding.nikobus`.  Enable `DEBUG` logging to discover addresses that will be logged.  In openHAB 2, this can be performed from the console at the `openhab>` prompt:

```
log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.nikobus
log:tail
```

Press Control-C to stop monitoring the log and return to the prompt.

Please see [here](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/logging.html) for more details on the subject.

Once configured, each push button press should produce a log entry as:

```
... Received command '#N40F9CA' ...
```

The six characters following `#N` are the push button's address, `40F9CA` in the example above.

To find out the address of module(s), press and hold the yellow "mode" button on the module until it beeps. This will trigger the module to send out its identification on the bus, which should then be logged in openHAB.  In the openHAB's log, one should see an entry similar to:

```
... Received command '$18C96400100167FF78607` ...
```

The four characters following `$18` are the module's address. In the example above, that's `C964`.

## Bridge Configuration

Binding can connect to the PC-Link via serial interface.

```
Bridge nikobus:pc-link:mypclink [ port = "<serial port>", refreshInterval = <interval> ] {
}
```

where:

* `port` is the name of the serial port used to connect to the Nikobus installation,
* `refreshInterval` defines how often binding reads Nikobus module's status, so having i.e. 30 as above, binding will read one moduleâ€™s status each 30s, iterating through all modules, one by one. If one does not specify `refreshInterval`, default value is taken (60s).

## Thing Configuration

Once connected to the Nikobus installation using a bridge, one can communicate with:

* `switch-module`,
* `dimmer-module`,
* `rollershutter-module`,
* `push-button`.

### Modules

Each module is defined by its address and contains 12 outputs (channels), where `output-1` corresponds to module's first output, `output-2` to module's second output and so on. If physical module has less outputs, only those channels can be used (i.e. `05-002-02` has only 4 outputs, so only channels 1-4 can be used).

Large module contains 2 channel groups, where the first group controls channels 1-6 and the second one controls channels 7-12. The small module contains only a single channel group controlling all 4 channels.

All commands sent to/received from the Nikobus switch module are for a single channel group.

In order to be able to read the status of a Nikobus module channel or to switch a channel directly on the module without mimicking a button press, items for each channel of a module needs to be configured.

#### switch-module

```
Thing switch-module BC00
```

Defines a `switch-module` with address `BC00`.

| channel   | type   | description  |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| output-1  | Switch | Output 1     |
| output-2  | Switch | Output 2     |
| output-3  | Switch | Output 3     |
| output-4  | Switch | Output 4     |
| output-5  | Switch | Output 5     |
| output-6  | Switch | Output 6     |

| output-8  | Switch | Output 8     |
| output-9  | Switch | Output 9     |
| output-10 | Switch | Output 10    |
| output-11 | Switch | Output 11    |
| output-12 | Switch | Output 12    |

#### dimmer-module

```
Thing dimmer-module D969
```

Defines a `dimmer-module` with address `D969`.

| channel   | type   | description  |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| output-1  | Dimmer | Output 1     |
| output-2  | Dimmer | Output 2     |
| output-3  | Dimmer | Output 3     |
| output-4  | Dimmer | Output 4     |
| output-5  | Dimmer | Output 5     |
| output-6  | Dimmer | Output 6     |
| output-7  | Dimmer | Output 7     |
| output-8  | Dimmer | Output 8     |
| output-9  | Dimmer | Output 9     |
| output-10 | Dimmer | Output 10    |
| output-11 | Dimmer | Output 11    |
| output-12 | Dimmer | Output 12    |

#### rollershutter-module

```
Thing rollershutter-module 4C6C
```

Defines a `rollershutter-module` with address `4C6C`.

| channel   | type          | description  |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| output-1  | Rollershutter | Output 1     |
| output-2  | Rollershutter | Output 2     |
| output-3  | Rollershutter | Output 3     |
| output-4  | Rollershutter | Output 4     |
| output-5  | Rollershutter | Output 5     |
| output-6  | Rollershutter | Output 6     |

### Buttons

Once an openHAB item has been configured as a Nikobus button, it will receive a status update to ON when the physical button is pressed. When an item receives the ON command from openHAB, it will send a simulated button press to the Nikobus. This means one could also define virtual buttons in openHAB with non-existing addresses (e.g., `000001`) and use those in the programming of Nikobus installation.

To configure an item for a button in openHAB with address `28092A`, use the following format:

```
Thing push-button 28092A
```

Since all the channels in the entire channel group are switched to their new state, it's important that openHAB knows the current state of all the channels in that group. Otherwise a channel which was switched on by a button, may be switched off again by the command.


In order to keep an up to date state of the channels in openHAB, button configurations can be extended to include detail on which channel groups the button press affects.

When configured, the status of the channel groups to which the button is linked, will be queried every time the button is pressed. Every status query takes between ~300 ms, so to get the best performance, only add the affected channel groups in the configuration, which has the following format:

```
Thing push-button <address> [ impactedModules = "<moduleAddress>-<channelGroup>, <moduleAddress>-<channelGroup>, ..." ]
```

where:

* `moduleAddress` represents the address of the switch module,
* `channelGroup` represents the first or second channel group in the module.

 Example configurations may look like:

```
Thing push-button 28092A [ impactedModules = "4C6C-2" ]
```

In addition to the status requests triggered by button presses, there is also a scheduled status update interval defined by the `refreshInterval` parameter and explained above.

## Migration from V1 binding

A bridge needs to be added to the `.things` file:

```
Bridge nikobus:pc-link:mypclink [ port = "<serial port>", refreshInterval = 30 ] {
}
```

`port` is the port to use and should be the same as defined in `nikobus.cfg`, parameter `serial.port` of the v1 setup, so if one had:

```
serial.port=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

in `nikobus.cfg` than add

```
Bridge nikobus:pc-link:mypclink [ port = "/dev/ttyUSB0", refreshInterval = 30 ] {
}
```

In order to use Nikobus modules, each needs to be defined within the `.things` file:

* using `switch-module` for switching module i.e. 05-000-02,
* using `dimmer-module` for dim-controller i.e 05-007-02,
* using `rollershutter-module` for rollershutter module.

Address of the modules are the same as they were in v1 binding.

So during v1 -> v2 migration one needs to go through the v1 `.items` file and for each line like:

```
Switch Light_GF_Kitchen_Bar "Bar" (GF_Kitchen, Lights) { nikobus="4C6C:3" }
```

add to the `.things` file (if not added already):

```
Thing switch-module 4C6C
```

for each line like:

```
Dimmer Light_GF_Dining_Ceiling "Ceiling" (GF_Dining, Lights) { nikobus="6B00:10" }
```

add

```
Thing dimmer-module 6B00
```

for each line like:

```
Rollershutter Shutter_GF_Corridor "Corridor" (GF_Corridor, gShuttersGF) { nikobus="D969:1" }
```

add

```
Thing rollershutter-module D969
```

and for each line like:

```
Switch S_1_15_2A { nikobus="#N9D592A[4C6C-1]" }
```

add

```
Thing push-button 9D592A "S_1_15_2A" [ impactedModules = "4C6C-1" ]
```

Make sure the `#N` is removed. Also, please note if such items (push buttons) are not used in the `.sitemap`, they should be removed from the `.items` file.

At the end the `.things` file should look something like:

```
Bridge nikobus:pc-link:mypclink [ port = "/dev/ttyUSB0", refreshInterval = 30 ] {

    Thing dimmer-module 6B00
    Thing dimmer-module 0700

    Thing switch-module BC00
    Thing switch-module 4C6C
    Thing switch-module A063

    Thing rollershutter-module D969

    Thing push-button 9D592A "S_1_15_2A" [ impactedModules = "4C6C-1" ]
}
```

Please make sure the mapping is correct - switch to `switch-module`, dim-controller to `dimmer-module` and rollershutter controller to `rollershutter-module`.

Next step is to migrate `.items` file. Entries as:

```
Switch Light_GF_Dining_Wall "Wall" (GF_Dining, Lights) [ "Lighting" ] { nikobus="4C6C:12" }
```

should be updated to

```
Switch Light_GF_Dining_Wall "Wall" (GF_Dining, Lights) [ "Lighting" ] { nikobus="nikobus:switch-module:mypclink:4C6C:output-12" }
```

entries as

```
Dimmer Light_GF_Dining_Ceiling 	"Ceiling" (GF_Dining, Lights) { nikobus="6B00:10" }
```

should be updated to

```
Dimmer Light_GF_Dining_Ceiling 	"Ceiling" (GF_Dining, Lights) { channel="nikobus:dimmer-module:mypclink:6B00:output-10" }
```

and entries as

```
Rollershutter Shutter_GF_Corridor "Corridor" (GF_Corridor, gShuttersGF) {nikobus="D969:1"}
```

should be updated to

```
Rollershutter Shutter_GF_Corridor "Corridor" (GF_Corridor, gShuttersGF) {nikobus="nikobus:rollershutter-module:mypclink:D969:output-1"}
```

With above in place, existing `.sitemap` should work as before.
