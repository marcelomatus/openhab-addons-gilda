# IP Camera Binding

This binding allows you to use most IP cameras in openHAB and has many features, so please take the time to read through this guide to learn the many hidden features and different ways to work with cameras that you may not know about. 
I recommend purchasing a brand of camera that has an open API, as many of the features use far less CPU when done with an API camera.
They usually have better picture quality and more features compared to lower priced cameras.

To see what features each brand has implemented from their APIs, please see this post:

<https://community.openhab.org/t/ipcamera-new-ip-camera-binding/42771>

## How to Get Help

+ Check this readme to see if there are any special setup steps for your brand of camera.
+ Check to see if the camera is offline, if so there will be a reason listed.
+ Always look at the log files with TRACE enabled.
To enable TRACE logging, enter this in the openHAB console ``log:set TRACE org.openhab.binding.ipcamera``.
+ Search the forum using any messages to find how others with the same problem have already solved it.
+ Only after doing the above ask for help in the forum and create a new thread.

## Special Notes for Different Brands

### Generic RTSP Cameras

This binding can turn a RTSP stream into snapshots (.jpg still pictures), create motion and audio alarms, cast the camera stream and much more. 
FFmpeg is required to be installed for these features to work and this must be done manually.
Under Linux, FFmpeg can be installed very easily see [Video Streams](#video-streams).

The Image channel will not update when using FFmpeg to create snapshots, so you will need to use one of the other much better methods like `ipcamera.jpg` or any of the streams that are explained in this readme.
If your camera does have a snapshot URL, provide it to the binding via the config called `SNAPSHOT_URL_OVERRIDE` after first testing the URL in any browser.
Once provided, the binding will then barely use any CPU load for snapshot tasks.
When using FFmpeg to create snapshots, it requires more CPU and you can turn this CPU load on and off via the `updateImageNow` channel using a switch or rule.
You can forget about using the switch if you setup the config `IMAGE_UPDATE_EVENTS` to be equal to 1 and then it runs all the time unless you move the switch to OFF.
Snapshots generated by FFmpeg use the key frames (iFrames) only to lower the CPU load, and since some cameras only produce a key frame every 2 second with their default settings, this will effect how often a snapshot is produced.
Some cameras allow the keyframe to be created every second or a different amount by the user, refer to your cameras manual and support on how to do this.

### ESP32 Cameras

These cameras do not have the ability to create H.264 streams and hence can not be used with HLS, however all other features should work.
See the [Full Example](#full-example) section to see how to setup these cameras.
Due to many custom firmwares available, you may need to ask the firmware developer what the URLs are for snapshots and MJPEG streams if they have changed from the defaults that the Arduino IDE sample code uses.

### Amcrest

It is better to always setup your AMCREST camera as a DAHUA thing type.
The old alarm polling method is used if you setup as AMCREST and the newer better event based method is used if you setup as DAHUA instead, all other features should be the same between the two. 
Please read the special notes for Dahua as they will apply.

### Dahua

For MJPEG to work you need to set the first sub-stream to be in MJPEG format for the default settings to work, otherwise you can override the default with STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE with a valid URL for MJPEG streams.

### Hikvision

+ For MJPEG to work you need to set the first sub-stream to be in MJPEG format for the default settings to work, otherwise you can override the default with STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE with a valid URL for MJPEG streams.
+ The CGI/API and also ONVIF are disabled by default on these cameras, so enable and create user details for ONVIF that are the same user/pass as what you have given the binding. If your camera does not have PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) then you can leave ONVIF disabled and just enable the CGI/API.
+ Each alarm you wish to use must have `Notify Surveillance Center` enabled under each alarms settings in the control panel of the camera itself. 

If you need a channel or control updated in case you have made a change with the cameras app, you can call a refresh on it by using a cron rule.


```java
import org.eclipse.smarthome.core.types.RefreshType

rule "refresh"
when
    Time cron "0 */15 * * * ? *"
then
    //your ITEMS to refresh every 15 minutes here
    Item.sendCommand(RefreshType.REFRESH)
end
```

### Hikvision NVRs

In case your Hikvision NVR does not communicate with the binding, make sure that:

* ISAPI is enabled in the NVR settings.
* ONVIF is enabled and a user/pass created that match the bindings.
* RTSP is enabled.
* Some NVR's allow each camera to be exposed on a set port to give direct access to each camera, some users report this works the best and needs to be enabled.

Some older versions of these NVRs require setting a different snapshot URL (`SNAPSHOT_URL_OVERRIDE`), as well as `FFMPEG_INPUT`. 
The older ones use the same URLs just with 'ISAPI' removed.

```java
Thing ipcamera:HIKVISION:West "West Camera"
[
    IPADDRESS="192.168.0.XX",
    USERNAME="username",
    PASSWORD="password",
    ONVIF_PORT=8000, //normally 80 check what it needs
    PORT=80,
    NVR_CHANNEL=4,
    SERVER_PORT=54324,
    FFMPEG_OUTPUT="/etc/openhab2/html/cameras/camera-west/",
    FFMPEG_INPUT="rtsp://192.168.0.XX:554/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/401"
]
```

### Foscam

* If the user/pass is wrong the camera can lockout and refuse to answer the binding requiring a reboot of the camera, so be sure the details are correct.
* To use MJPEG streaming you need to enable one of the streams to use this format. This can be done by entering this into any browser:`http://ip:88/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=setSubStreamFormat&format=1&usr=admin&pwd=password`
* If your camera does not support MJPEG as some Foscams no longer do, then you can set `STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE="ffmpeg"` to use your CPU to generate a MJPEG stream.
* Some FOSCAM cameras need to have a detection area listed in the URL when you enable the motion alarm.

As each Foscam model has a different resolution and two different URLs, this makes it difficult to automate, so an override feature was added to create your own "enable the alarm" URL. 
This setting is called `MOTION_URL_OVERRIDE` and the steps to using it are:

1. Enable the motion alarm in the web interface of your camera and setup any areas you wish movement to be ignored in. E.g. tree branches moving in the wind.
2. Use any web browser to fetch this URL `https://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=getMotionDetectConfig1&usr=xxxxx&pwd=xxxxx`
3. Use the information returned by the above URL to create the override settings.

An example for a Foscam C2 is...

```
/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=setMotionDetectConfig1&isEnable=1&snapInterval=1&schedule0=281474976710655&schedule1=281474976710655&schedule2=281474976710655&schedule3=281474976710655&schedule4=281474976710655&schedule5=281474976710655&schedule6=281474976710655&x1=0&y1=0&width1=10000&height1=10000&sensitivity1=1&valid1=1&linkage=6&usr=xxxxx&pwd=xxxxx
```

Another example is:

```
/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=setMotionDetectConfig&isEnable=1&linkage=0001&sensitivity=1&triggerInterval=15&schedule0=281474976710655&schedule1=281474976710655&schedule2=281474976710655&schedule3=281474976710655&schedule4=281474976710655&schedule5=281474976710655&schedule6=281474976710655&area0=1023&area1=1023&area2=1023&area3=1023&area4=1023&area5=1023&area6=1023&area7=1023&area7=1023&area8=1023&area9=1023&usr=username&pwd=password
```

### Instar

+ For MJPEG to work you need to set the first sub-stream to be MJPEG format for the default settings to work, otherwise you can override the default with STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE with a valid URL for MJPEG streams.
+ Be sure to update to the latest firmware for your camera as Instar have made a lot of improvements recently, including adding MQTT features (MQTT is not needed for this binding to work).

## Discovery

The discovery feature of openHAB can be used to find any ONVIF cameras. 
This method should be preferred as it will discover the ports and URLs for you, making the setup much easier.
To use the discovery, just press the `+` icon located in the Inbox, then select the IpCamera binding from the list of installed bindings.
After the camera is discovered and added as a thing, you will need to provide the username and password for any cameras that require a login to work.

## Supported Things

If using openHAB's textual configuration or when needing to setup HABpanel/sitemaps, you are going to need to know what your camera is as a "thing type".
These are listed in CAPS below. Example: The thing type for a generic ONVIF camera is "ONVIF".

| Thing Type ID | Description |
|-|-|
| `AMCREST` | Use for all Amcrest Cameras that do not work as a Dahua thing. This uses an older polling method for alarm detection which is not as efficient as the newer method used in Dahua. Amcrest are made by Dahua and hence their cameras can be setup as a Dahua thing. |
| `DAHUA` | Use for all current Dahua and Amcrest cameras as they support an API as well as ONVIF. |
| `DOORBIRD` | Use for all current DOORBIRD cameras as they support an API as well as ONVIF. |
| `FOSCAM` | Use for all current FOSCAM HD Cameras as they support an API as well as ONVIF. |
| `HIKVISION` | Use for all current Hikvision cameras as they support an API as well as ONVIF. |
| `HTTPONLY` | For any camera that is not ONVIF compatible yet still has the ability to fetch a snapshot or stream with a URL. RTSP cameras should use this if they do not have ONVIF. |
| `INSTAR` | Use for all current INSTAR Cameras as they support an API as well as ONVIF. |
| `ONVIF` | Use for all ONVIF Cameras from any brand that does not have an API. |
| `GROUPDISPLAY` | Used to display or cast multiple cameras like they are a single camera. This is an advanced feature that may require some tweaking of the cameras settings to fully work. |

## Thing Configuration

After the camera is added, the first thing you need to configure is the login details for your camera.
If your camera is not ONVIF, you will also need to provide the binding with the cameras URLs to the relevant URL override field/s.
For ONVIF cameras that auto detect the wrong URL, the override configs can be used to force a URL of your choosing.

Leave any `user:pass@` out of any URLs, as the binding will handle this for you.
Not only does this hide your login details, it will also make changing your password much easier if it is only located in 1 field.

Below are a list of the configuration parameters that can be used in textual configuration. 
If you do not specify any of these, the binding will use the default which should work in most cases and should be tried first. 
Very few of them are needed in order to get a working camera and examples are shown in the [Full Example](#full-example) section.

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| `IPADDRESS`| The IP address of your camera or NVR. You can also use Hostnames if your camera is not locked to a set IP. |
| `PORT`| This port will be used for HTTP calls for fetching the snapshot and any API calls. |
| `ONVIF_PORT`| The port your camera uses for ONVIF connections. This is needed for PTZ movement, Events, and the auto discovery of RTSP and snapshot URLs. |
| `SERVER_PORT`| The port that will serve the video streams and snapshots back to openHAB without authentication. You can choose any number, but it must be unique and unused for each camera that you setup. Setting the port to -1 (default), will turn all file serving off and some features will fail to work. Also learn about the `IP_WHITELIST` feature if you enable this and use your firewall and subnets to isolate your camera/s from the internet. |
| `USERNAME`| User name used to connect to your camera. Leave blank if your camera does not use login details. |
| `PASSWORD`| Leave blank if your camera does not use login details. |
| `ONVIF_MEDIA_PROFILE`| 0 (default) is your cameras Mainstream and the numbers above 0 are the substreams if your camera has any. Any auto discovered URLs will use the stream this indicates. You can always override the URLs should you wish to use something different. |
| `POLL_CAMERA_MS`| Time in milliseconds between fetching a JPG. Note that most features will not poll and are done on demand to keep network traffic at a minimum. If using the GIF preroll feature, this will cause the camera to always fetch a snapshot every poll. A preroll of 0 will mean the RTSP source is used and the snapshot is not polled unless needed for another feature. |
| `IMAGE_UPDATE_EVENTS`| The `Image` channel can be set to update in a number of ways to help reduce network traffic. Recommend you DO NOT USE the image channel. See section on snapshots and streams for more info.  |
| | `0` - Default and the RECOMMENDED setting, the Image channel never updates. |
| | `1` - Update the Image channel only when the `updateImageNow` channel is turned on.|
| | `2` - Start of Motion Alarms will cause the Image channel to update next poll. |
| | `3` - Start of Audio Alarm will cause the Image channel to update next poll. |
| | `23` - Start of Motion and Audio Alarms will the Image channel to update next poll. |
| | `4` - During Motion Alarm the Image channel will update every poll until Alarm stops. |
| | `5` - During Audio Alarm the Image channel will update every poll until Alarm stops. |
| | `45` - During Motion and Audio Alarms the Image channel will update every poll until both alarms stop. |
| `UPDATE_IMAGE`| The default state of the channel `updateImageNow` when openHAB starts. When switched OFF (default) the image channel will NOT update unless you override this with the updateImageNow channel. |
| `NVR_CHANNEL`| Set this to `1` (default) if it is a standalone camera, or to the input channel number of your NVR that the camera is connected to. This effects the hard coded URLs for the API based cameras. |
| `SNAPSHOT_URL_OVERRIDE`| Leave this empty to auto detect the snapshot URL if the camera has ONVIF, or enter a HTTP address if you wish to override with a different address. Setting this to `ffmpeg` forces the camera to use FFmpeg to create the snapshots from the RTSP stream. |
| `MOTION_URL_OVERRIDE`| Foscam only, for custom enable motion alarm use. More info found in Foscam's setup steps. |
| `AUDIO_URL_OVERRIDE`| Foscam only, for custom enable audio alarm use. More info found in Foscam's setup steps. |
| `STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE`| A HTTP URL for MJPEG format streams only, it can not be a RTSP URL. If you enter 'ffmpeg' the MJPEG stream can be generated from the RTSP URL if you have FFmpeg installed, see the below section on this. |
| `FFMPEG_INPUT`| Best if this stream is in H.264 format and can be RTSP or HTTP URLs. Leave this blank to use the auto detected RTSP address for ONVIF cameras, or enter a URL for any type of stream that FFmpeg can use as an input. |
| `FFMPEG_LOCATION`| The full path including the filename for where you have installed FFmpeg. The default should work for most Linux installs but if using windows use this format: `c:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe` |
| `FFMPEG_OUTPUT`| The full path where FFmpeg has the ability to write files to ending with a slash. For windows use  this format: `c:\openhabconf\html\ipcamera\` |
| | If you would like to expose the GIF files to your static server, you can set `FFMPEG_OUTPUT="/etc/openhab2/html/cameras/camera-name/"` |
| `FFMPEG_HLS_OUT_ARGUMENTS`| This gives you direct access to specify your own FFmpeg options to be used. Default: `-strict -2 -f lavfi -i aevalsrc=0 -acodec aac -vcodec copy -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 2 -hls_list_size 4` |
| `FFMPEG_GIF_OUT_ARGUMENTS`| This gives you direct access to specify your own FFmpeg options to be used for animated GIF files. Default: `-r 2 -filter_complex scale=-2:360:flags=lanczos,setpts=0.5*PTS,split[o1][o2];[o1]palettegen[p];[o2]fifo[o3];[o3][p]paletteuse` |
| `FFMPEG_MJPEG_ARGUMENTS` | Allows you to change the settings for creating a MJPEG stream from RTSP using FFmpeg. Possible reasons to change this would be to rotate or rescale the picture from the camera, change the jpeg compression for better quality or the FPS rate. |
| `FFMPEG_MOTION_ARGUMENTS` | This gives access to the FFmpeg parameters for detecting motion alarms from a RTSP stream. One possible use for this is to use the CROP feature to ignore any trees that move in the wind or a timecode stamp. Crop will not remove the trees from your picture, it only ignores the movement of the tree. Default is an empty string. |
| `GIF_PREROLL`| Store this many snapshots from BEFORE you trigger a GIF creation. Default: `0` will not use snapshots and will instead use a realtime stream from the FFMPEG_INPUT URL |
| `GIF_POSTROLL`| How long in seconds to create a GIF from a stream. Alternatively if `GIF_PREROLL` is set to value greater than `0`, this is how many snapshots to use AFTER you trigger a GIF creation as snapshots occur at the poll rate. |
| `IP_WHITELIST`| Enter any IPs inside brackets that you wish to allow to access the video stream. `DISABLE` the default value will turn this feature off.  Example: `IP_WHITELIST="(127.0.0.1)(192.168.0.99)"` |
| `PTZ_CONTINUOUS`| If set to false (default) the camera will move using Relative commands, If set to true the camera will instead use continuous movements and will require an `OFF` command to stop the movement. |

## Channels

The openHAB UI will show a full list of channels and the descriptions, most are easy to understand however any channels which need a further explanation will be added here.
Each camera brand will have different channels depending on how much of the support for an API has been added. 
The channels are kept consistent as much as possible from brand to brand to make upgrading to a different branded camera easier and to help when sharing rules with other users in the forum.

**externalMotion**

This channel is intended to allow any external sensor the ability to inform the binding that there is motion in the cameras field of view. 
Note: It will not be passed onto your camera and will not trigger any recordings, it is purely for the bindings own set of features. 
An example of how this is useful is if your camera either has no motion alarm features, or you have bugs tripping the built in sensors, you can use this channel with a ZWave PIR sensor to inform the camera of motion.
This becomes more important when you start to use Camera groups that dynamically change the display order of the cameras based on if there is movement or not.
It can also be handy to use this when doing testing as it allows motion to be simulated with the press of a button. 

**updateImageNow**

This control can be used to manually start and stop updating the Image channel with a picture, or it will start and stop FFmpeg from creating snapshots from a RTSP source depending on how the bindings config parameters are set. 
The `UPDATE_IMAGE` config sets the state this control is set to on startup/reboot of openHAB.
When ON the image channel will update at the `POLL_CAMERA_MS` rate. 
Note that cameras that create snapshots from RTSP using FFmpeg will not update the image channel at all and the better methods like ipcamera.jpg covered in this readme, are the recommended way to achieve a picture. 
When OFF the Image channel will NOT update, but the other methods of achieving a picture or stream will still work. 
If you need to update the image channel more often then every 5 seconds, please see the snapshot and stream sections of this readme to learn how to get a picture without using the Image channel. 

**ffmpegMotionControl**

This control allows FFmpeg to detect movement from a RTSP or HTTP source and inform openHAB.
The higher the number, the less sensitive the camera is to movement or you have to wave your hand faster to trigger the alarm.
It is best described in the first few posts of this thread, along with how to fault find it using a terminal/command line.
<https://community.openhab.org/t/how-to-turn-a-cameras-rtsp-stream-into-motion-detection/89906>
You can link a Switch and a Slider to this channel at the same time to have both ON/OFF switch control, as well as a slider to change the threshold.
The channel that will move is called `ffmpegMotionAlarm`.

**thresholdAudioAlarm**

Most of the API cameras have a separate ON/OFF channel, but for non API cameras that use FFmpeg to create an Audio Alarm from a RTSP source, this channel can be linked to a Switch and a Slider.
Linking both controls to this channel at the same time gives ON/OFF control as well as a slider to change the threshold. 
The value of the slider is the value in dB that is detected as no noise/alarm. 
Higher values are more sensitive and will trigger the Alarm with quieter / less noise.

**updateGif**

When this control is turned ON it will trigger an animated Gif to be created by FFmpeg. 
Once the file is created the control will auto turn itself back to OFF which can be used to trigger a rule to email/Pushover/Telegram the file to you. 
When `GIF_PREROLL` is set to a value higher than 0, the binding will create and use snapshots (JPG) instead of using the RTSP feed from the camera, which is the default behavior when the `GIF_PREROLL` is set to 0 or not defined. 
`IMAGE_UPDATE_EVENTS` must be set to always update the image and `POLL_CAMERA_MS` sets how often the snapshot is added to the FIFO buffer that creates the animated GIF. 
The snapshot files are not deleted but are overwritten each time a gif is created.
These files 'snapshotxx.jpg' can also be used by yourself to create and email Jpeg files also giving you a number to choose from in case your camera has delayed footage. 
The files are placed into the folder specified by the config `FFMPEG_OUTPUT`.
You can now change the files name by using the channel `gifFilename` Just change the string in that channel and that is what the file will be called, handy if you want the date and time stamped into the file.

**lastMotionType**

Cameras with multiple alarm types will update this with which alarm detected motion, i.e. a lineCrossing, faceDetection or item stolen alarm. 
You can use this to create a timestamp of when the last motion was detected by creating a rule when this channel is updated.

items:

```java
String BabyCamLastMotionType "Last Motion Type" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:BabyCamera:lastMotionType" }
DateTime BabyCamLastMotionTime "Last Update [%1$ta %1$tR]"
```

rules:

```java
rule "Create timestamp of last movement"
    when
    Item BabyCamLastMotionType received update
    then
    BabyCamLastMotionTime.postUpdate( new DateTimeType() )
end
```

## Moving PTZ Cameras

To move a camera with this binding you need an ONVIF camera that supports one of the following:

+ Absolute movements
+ Relative movements
+ Continuous movements  
+ Presets

To test your cameras compatibility and also to create some preset locations, use a free program called `ONVIF Device Manager` (ODM for short).
Not all ONVIF cameras work with all of the methods, so testing first to confirm what works is a good idea and the presets can not be created with the binding, only loaded after they are already created.
After creating new or changing existing presets, it may be necessary to restart the binding before they can be used. 
You can create names using the mappings feature of the selection element.
See docs here <https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/sitemaps.html#mappings>

Moving the camera using Relative or Continuous (the config `PTZ_CONTINUOUS` must be true) movements can be done by sending the INCREASE and DECREASE commands to the Pan, Tilt and Zoom channels.
When the config is set to false (the default if not specified) the binding will send Relative movements. 
There are some widgets created in the HABpanel widget gallery that you can download and use right away saving you time if your camera supports either presets, relative or continuous modes.
For sitemaps the below example can be used.
The OFF command (can be sent to any of the PTZ channels) will stop the cameras movements in the case of continuous being selected in the things config setup.

item:

```java

Number BabyCamGotoPreset "Goto Preset" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:BabyCamera:gotoPreset" }
Dimmer BabyCamPan "Pan [%d] left/right" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:BabyCamera:pan" }
Dimmer BabyCamTilt "Tilt [%d] up/down" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:BabyCamera:tilt" }
Dimmer BabyCamZoom "Zoom [%d] in/out" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:BabyCamera:zoom" }

```

sitemap:

```java

Selection item=BabyCamGotoPreset
Switch item=BabyCamPan mappings=[INCREASE="Left",OFF="STOP",DECREASE="Right"]
Switch item=BabyCamTilt mappings=[INCREASE="Down",OFF="STOP",DECREASE="Up"]
Switch item=BabyCamZoom mappings=[INCREASE="Zoom In",OFF="STOP",DECREASE="Zoom Out"]
Slider item=BabyCamPan icon=movecontrol
Slider item=BabyCamTilt icon=movecontrol
Slider item=BabyCamZoom icon=zoom

```

Moving the camera to an EXACT repeatable location (Preset 1 saved location) with a rule:

```java
BabyCamGotoPreset.sendCommand(1)
```

Moving the camera to an EXACT repeatable location using Absolute movement with a rule:

```java
BabyCamPan.sendCommand(22)
BabyCamTilt.sendCommand(60)
BabyCamZoom.sendCommand(0)
```

## FFmpeg Motion and Audio Alarms

Any camera with a RTSP feed can use FFmpeg to create either a `ffmpegMotionAlarm` or `audioAlarm`.
Even if your camera has a motion alarm, you may find that it does not provide enough flexibility to ignore moving trees, or have its sensitivity adjusted on the fly to reduce its sensitivity during rain. 
This is where this feature can come in handy as you can even add your own FFmpeg arguments (options) to use the Crop or any other FFmpeg filter, as this wont effect the video feeds you watch.
<https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Examples-52>

To get this working:

+ Provide a RTSP URL to the bindings config `FFMPEG_MOTION_INPUT`, or you can leave it blank to use the auto detected URL if your camera has ONVIF.
The advantage of using a separate feed for this is that you can provide a low resolution and low frame rate feed to keep the CPU load on your server to a minimum without having to sacrifice the feeds quality that you record or use to view the camera with.
+ Have FFmpeg installed and the binding knows the location of where to find it.
+ You have the resolution and FPS at realistic settings for your CPU. You need to reach 1.x speed otherwise the alarm will lag further behind realtime the longer you have this running.
1080p and 10 fps maximum for an ARM processor is probably a good place to start testing or even lower if you can.
+ Set the `ffmpegMotionControl` channel to 16 with a slider control and if the alarm stays on increase the value until it works as desired.
If it will not trigger, lower the control until it does.
+ Set the `ffmpegMotionControl` to OFF or 0 and it stops using your CPU.
You can link this same channel to BOTH a switch and a slider at the same time if you like to have both types of controls.
+ The output of the alarm will go to a channel called `ffmpegMotionAlarm` and you can use the `lastMotionType` channel to determine which alarm was last tripped if your camera has multiple alarm types.

**audioAlarm**

This works in much the same way, just with different channels. 
If you setup a lower resolution URL in the config `FFMPEG_MOTION_INPUT` you need to ensure it contains audio otherwise this feature wont work.

## Image / Snapshots

There are a number of ways to use snapshots with this binding.
There are multiple advantages to using these methods from the binding instead of directly from the camera. 

**Ways to use snapshots are:**

+ Use the cameras URL so it passes from the camera to your end device ie a tablet, without passing any data through the openHAB server. This is always the best option if it works.
+ Request a snapshot with the URL `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:54321/ipcamera.jpg`.
The IP is for your openHAB server not the camera, and 54321 is the SERVER_PORT number that you specified in the bindings setup. If you find the snapshot is old you can set the gif preroll to a number above 0 and this forces the camera to keep updating the stored JPG in ram.
This file does not exist on disk and is served out of ram to keep disk writes to a minimum with this binding. 
The binding can serve a JPG file much faster than a camera can directly, as a camera waits for a keyframe, then has to compress the data, before it can finally be sent.
All of this takes time giving you a delay compared to serving the file from Ram and can make a sitemap or HABpanel UI feel slow to respond if the pictures take time to appear.
The ipcamera.jpg can also be cast, as most cameras can not cast their snapshots without using the binding.
+ Use the `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:54321/snapshots.mjpeg` to request a stream of snapshots to be delivered in MJPEG format. 
See the streaming section for more info.
+ Use the update GIF feature and use a preroll value >0. 
This creates a number of snapshots in the FFmpeg output folder called snapshotXXX.jpg where XXX starts at 0 and increases each poll amount of time. 
This means you can get a snapshot from an exact amount of time before, on, or after triggering the GIF to be created. 
Handy for cameras which lag due to slow processors and buffering, or if you do not want a hand blocking the image when the door bell was pushed.
These snapshots can be fetched either directly as they exist on disk, or via this URL format. 
`http://192.168.xxx.xxx:54321/snapshot0.jpg` Where the IP is your openHAB server and the port is what is setup in the binding as the SERVER_PORT.
+ The Image channel can be used but is not recommended unless the poll time is above 8 seconds as the image data passes through the event bus of openHAB that can create bottlenecks.
+ Also worth a mention is that you can off load cameras to a software package running on a separate hardware server such as, Motion, Shinobi and Zoneminder.

## Video Streams

To get some of the video formats working, you need to install the FFmpeg program. 
Visit their site here to learn how <https://ffmpeg.org/>

Under Linux, FFmpeg can be installed very easily with this one command.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**IMPORTANT:**
The binding has its own file server that works by allowing access to the snapshot and video streams with no user/password for requests that come from an IP located in the `IP_WHITELIST`. 
Requests from external IPs or internal requests that are not on the `IP_WHITELIST` will fail to get any answer. 
If you prefer to use your own firewall instead, you can also choose to make the `IP_WHITELIST` equal "DISABLE" (the default since the feature also needs a valid SERVER_PORT set) to turn this feature off and then all internal IPs will have access.

There are multiple ways to get a moving picture, to use them just enter the URL into any browser using `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:SERVER_PORT/name.format` replacing the name.format with one of the options that are listed below:

+ **ipcamera.m3u8** HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) which uses H.264 compression. 
This can be used to cast to Chromecast devices, or can display video in many browsers (some browsers require a plugin to be installed).
Please understand that this format due to the way it works will give you lag behind realtime, more on this below.
+ **ipcamera.mjpeg** whilst needing more bandwidth, it is far more compatible for displaying in a wider range of UIs and browsers.
It is normally 1 second or less behind real-time.
FFmpeg can be used to create this stream if your camera does not create one for you, but this uses more CPU. 
A lot of cameras limit the resolution in this format, so consider using HLS, autofps.mjpeg, or snapshots.mjpeg instead which will be in a higher resolution.
+ **snapshots.mjpeg** is a special MJPEG stream created from the cameras snapshots that are taken at the polling rate.
+ **autofps.mjpeg** This requires a camera that has a motion alarm to be turned on or it will only send a picture every 8 seconds.
You can also use the `externalMotion` channel to change the framerate.
This feature is designed to keep data traffic to your mobile devices as low as possible by automatically sending 1fps when motion is occurring, but only 1 picture every 8 seconds when the picture has no motion.
The idea is to not send lots of pictures if the picture has not changed as doing so only eats up your data plan.
+ **ipcamera.gif** This is small in size and very compatible and handy to use in push notifications, Pushover, Telegram, or emails.
You can cast it which can be handy to show a moving picture that keeps repeating on a Google/Nest home hub or your wall mounted tablet. 
+ MP4 recordings can be created by the binding and FFmpeg, more on this below.

This forum thread has examples of how to use snapshots and streams in a sitemap.

## MJPEG Streams

Cameras that have built in MJPEG abilities can stream to openHAB with the MJPEG format with next to no CPU load, less than 1 second lag, and FFmpeg does not need to be installed.
Cameras without this ability can still use this binding to convert their RTSP H.264 format to MJPEG (keep reading for more on this below) and this will take a lot of CPU power to handle the conversion. 
The alternative HLS format does not need the conversion and does not use any CPU to speak of.
For video without a delay, you need MJPEG and without a camera that can create it, you will need to use a lot of CPU power. This could be done in a dedicated video server which will be the only way with lots of cameras unless you purchase cameras that have the ability built in.

An alternative way to keep the CPU load low is to use the `snapshots.mjpeg` feature of the binding to create a stream from the cameras snapshots instead of the RTSP stream.
This is limited to 1 frame a second but often results in far greater picture quality, so be sure to try the different ways and choose what you prefer.

The main cameras that can do MJPEG with very low CPU load are Amcrest, Dahua, Hikvision, Foscam HD and Instar HD.
To set this up, see [Special Notes for Different Brands](#special-notes-for-different-brands).
The binding can then distribute this stream to many devices around your home whilst the camera only sees a single open stream.

To request the MJPEG stream from the binding, all you need to do is use this link changing the IP to that of your openHAB server and the SERVER_PORT to match the settings in the bindings setup for that camera. 
ipcamera.mjpeg is not changed and stays the same for all of your cameras, it is the port that changes between multiple cameras, the rest stays the same. 

<http://openHABIP:SERVER_PORT/ipcamera.mjpeg>

To use this feature, all you need to do is set the config as follows `STREAM_URL_OVERRIDE="ffmpeg"` to use your CPU to generate the MJPEG stream with FFmpeg.
If you leave the option blank the binding will warn you in the logs and still use FFmpeg, so by adding this line it will remove the warning from your logs. 
For cameras that have an API you can opt to not use the cameras stream and use FFmpeg instead by doing this as well should you need the streams for other reasons.

FFmpeg may require you to lower the resolution and/or the FPS to lower the CPU load down enough to run, you may need to experiment.
To change the settings used by this feature the binding exposes the config `FFMPEG_MJPEG_ARGUMENTS` which the default is currently `-q:v 5 -r 2 -vf scale=640:-2 -update 1` where 5 is the JPG quality/compression setting, and -r 2 is how many frames per second to try and create.
In this case it will create 2 frames every second. 
`-vf scale=640:-2` will lower the resolution down to make the video 640 pixels wide.
You can remove this to use the same resolution as the camera is set to use, however it may become a trade off and you may get less frames per second if you raise the resolution.
Always try to get the default settings working first before you begin to experiment and if your stream is above 1080p and 10 frames per second, consider lowering it if you have issues on an ARM based server like a Raspberry PIx.
 
## snapshots.mjpeg and autofps.mjpeg

These similar features allow you to request a MJPEG stream created by the binding with low CPU usage from the cameras snapshots.
Snapshots are usually high resolution and look great, however they are limited to a max of 1 frame per second (1 FPS).
The reason this is more useful than snapshots on their own, is some UIs will flash white or black when a snapshot is refreshing, this does not happen with snapshots.mjpeg and is the same bandwidth and CPU load as just using snapshots!

The autofps.mjpeg feature will display a snapshot that updates every 8 seconds to keep network traffic low, then when motion is detected it will automatically increase the frames to every second until the motion stops.
This means lower traffic unless the picture is actually changing. 

Request the stream to be sent to an item with this URL. 
NOTE: The IP is openHAB's not your cameras IP and the 54321 is what you have set as the SERVER_PORT.

`http://192.168.xxx.xxx:54321/snapshots.mjpeg`

Use the following to display it in your sitemap.

```
Video url="http://192.168.0.32:54321/autofps.mjpeg" encoding="mjpeg"

Video url="http://192.168.0.32:54321/snapshots.mjpeg" encoding="mjpeg"
```

## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

HLS is a way of splitting the live stream up into small H.264 based files so it can be played in many browsers without using much CPU power and it can also contain audio. 
Because the files need to be created and are not streamed live, this creates a lag/delay behind real time that can be lowered (more on that below). 

The channel called 'startStream' can be used to create HLS non stop and remove the startup delay that comes with using this type of stream. 
The startup delay and the lag are two different things with the startup delay easily solved by turning this switch ON.
If the channel is OFF, the stream will start and stop automatically as required, but you will get a delay before the stream is fully running and this may cause you to need to ask twice for the stream.
With a fast server running openHAB it should only need to be requested once, but on slower ARM systems it takes a while for FFmpeg to get running at full speed.

It can be helpful sometimes to use this line in a rule to start the stream before it is needed further on in the rule `sendHttpGetRequest("http://192.168.0.2:54321/ipcamera.m3u8")` as the stream will stay running for 64 seconds.
This 64 second delay before the stream is stopped helps when you are moving back and forth in a UI, as the stream does not keep stopping and needing to start each time you move around the UI.
Cameras with H.264 format streams (most cameras except ESP32 based Cameras) can use the HLS format to stream to Chromecasts and Google/Nest devices.
Browsers that support this format can also display HLS using the webview or HABpanel items. 
Apple devices have excellent support for HLS due to the standard being invented by Apple so they work out of the box. 
Some browsers like Chrome may require a plugin or an update to be installed before they are able to display the video.

To use the HLS streaming features, you need to:

+ Set a valid `SERVER_PORT` as the default value of -1 will turn the feature off.
+ The audio format in the cameras settings must be AAC and not missing for Chromecast to work.
The binding will default to creating a silent AAC audio track which should be used until you have a working setup.
+ For cameras that do not auto detect the H.264 stream which is done for ONVIF cameras, you will need to use the `FFMPEG_INPUT` and provide a HTTP or RTSP link.
+ For ONVIF cameras the `ONVIF_MEDIA_PROFILE` needs to match a stream number you have setup for H.264.
For non ONVIF cameras you just need to check the URL in the last step works and is provided to the binding.
+ If streaming to a Chromecast that is not 4k capable, you need to ensure the stream 1080p or lower otherwise your Chromecast wont handle the stream.
Cameras with 3 streams are handy as you can have a 4k stream going to a NVR whilst a 720p stream can be cast to your TV whilst a 3rd can be for MJPEG format.
+ Consider using a SSD, HDD or a tmpfs (ram drive) if using SD/flash cards as the HLS streams are written to the FFMPEG_OUTPUT folder.
Only a small amount of storage is needed.
I only use a micro SD cards with a ramdrive and have excellent performance.
+ Ensure FFmpeg is installed.

### Ram Drive Setup

To create a tmpfs of 20mb at /tmpfs/ run this command to open the file for editing. 
Recommend using 20Mb per camera that uses this location although it could use less than half that amount if carefully streamlined for less ram.
If using the FFmpeg `-hls_wrap wrap` option (causes issues for my Home Hub), you can get away with 5Mb per camera. 

```
nano /etc/fstab
```

Enter and save this at the bottom of the file using ctrl X when done.

```
tmpfs /tmpfs tmpfs defaults,nosuid,nodev,noatime,size=20m 0 0
```

### FFmpeg HLS Settings

Please get the default settings working first before playing with the advanced settings.

To get audio working you need to have the camera include audio in the stream and in a format that is supported by Chromecast or your browser, I suggest using `AAC` as MP3 is not supported by Google/Nest.
Then you need to change the HLS settings to what you need, some are suggestions below.

Less delay behind realtime (no audio) if your cameras iFrames are 1 second apart (-hls_time 1):

```bash
-strict -2 -f lavfi -i aevalsrc=0 -acodec aac -vcodec copy -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 1 -hls_list_size 4
```

For cameras with no audio in the stream (default setting).

```bash
-strict -2 -f lavfi -i aevalsrc=0 -acodec aac -vcodec copy -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 2 -hls_list_size 4
```

For cameras with audio in the stream.
Note: will break Chromecast if the camera does not send audio which is why this is not the default.

```bash
-strict -2 -acodec aac -vcodec copy -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 2 -hls_list_size 4
```

Some browsers require larger segment sizes to prevent choppy playback, this can be done with this setting to create 10 second segment files which increases the time before you can get playback working.

```bash
-strict -2 -f lavfi -i aevalsrc=0 -acodec aac -vcodec copy -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 4

```

### HLS Sitemap Examples

The webview version allows you to zoom in on the video when using the iOS app, the Video element version does not zoom, but it will pass through myopenHAB.

```

Text label="HLS Video Stream" icon="camera"{Video url="http://192.168.1.9:54321/ipcamera.m3u8" encoding="hls"}

Text label="HLS Webview Stream" icon="camera"{Webview url="http://192.168.1.9:54321/ipcamera.m3u8" height=15}

```

**Display multiple HLS streams side by side**

In order to display camera hls streams side by side you can also create a webView item and link it to a HTML file in the conf/html directory as follows:
The webView URL is that of your openHAB installation.

```
Webview url="http://192.168.6.4:8080/static/html/file.html" height=5

```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

## How to Cast a Camera

There are two ways to cast a camera.

1. openHAB Cloud Connector and using metadata/tags.
2. Chromecast Bindings `playuri` channel.

The first method once setup allows you to ask "OK Google show X camera", or "OK Google show X camera on Y display".
By optionally naming the display that you wish to use, it can be cast directly to your Chromecast (connected to your TV) by speaking to a Google Nest Mini.
This must use the HLS format and use the metadata tag shown below with the openHAB Cloud Connector setup.
Don't forget to ask Google to 'sync my devices' after adding the metadata. 
The synonyms in the tag allows Google to understand multiple names that the camera may be called by different people in your family.

Example of how this is done in an items file.

```
String FrontDoorCamHlsUrl "Front Door" { channel="ipcamera:ONVIF:FrontDoor:hlsUrl", synonyms="door bell, front camera", ga="Camera" [ protocols="hls" ] }

```

The second method is by using the Chromecast Binding and by sending the URL you wish to cast to the `playuri` channel.
You can cast the ipcamera.jpg (static picture), ipcamera.gif (looping moving picture), and ipcamera.m3u8 (aka HLS) for a non stop stream that uses low CPU and can also contain audio.

Example:

items

```
String KitchenHomeHubPlayURI { channel="chromecast:chromecast:KitchenHomeHub:playuri" }

```

In a rule...

```
KitchenHomeHubPlayURI.sendCommand("http://192.168.1.2:54321/ipcamera.m3u8")

```

## Animated GIF

This binding has a channel called `updateGif` and when this switch is turned 'ON' (either by a rule or manually) the binding will create an animated GIF called ipcamera.gif in the FFmpeg output folder.
You can change the filename using the channel that is called `gifFilename` and an example of how to use this in a rule can be seen under the MP4 recording section.
Both features are very similar.
Once the file is created the switch will turn 'OFF' and this can be used to trigger a rule to send the picture via email, pushover or telegram messages.
The channel `gifHistory` keeps a string of the last 50 filenames (separated by commas) until you reset the history.
The channel `gifHistoryLength` keeps track of how many filenames are in the gifHistory String.
You can send the '0' command to this channel to clear the gifHistory string at the same time as setting this channel back to 0.

The `updateGif` switch can be turned on with a rule triggered by an external zwave PIR sensor or the cameras own motion alarm, the choice and the logic can be created by yourself.
The feature has two options called preroll and postroll to be aware of.
When preroll is 0 (the default) the binding will use the RTSP stream to fetch the amount of seconds specified in the postroll config to create the GIF from.
By changing to a preroll value above 0 the binding will change to using snapshots as the source.
The time between the snapshots then becomes the polling time of the camera (1 seconds by default) and can be raised if you desire.
The snapshots are saved to disk and can be used as a feature that is described in the snapshot section above in more detail.

You can request the gif by using this URL, or by the path to where the file is stored:

<http://openHABIP:ServerPort/ipcamera.gif>

.items

```java
Switch DoorCamCreateGif "Create animated GIF" { channel="ipcamera:DAHUA:DoorCam:updateGif" }

```

.rules

```java
rule "Create front door camera GIF when front doorbell button pushed"
when
    Item FrontDoorbellButton changed to ON
then
    //Start creating the GIF
    DoorCamCreateGif.sendCommand(ON)
    //Cast a doorbell sound using the Chromecast binding.
    KitchenHomeHubPlayURI.sendCommand("http://192.168.1.8:8080/static/doorbell.mp3")
end

rule "Send doorbell GIF via Pushover"
when
    Item DoorCamCreateGif changed to OFF
then
    sendPushoverMessage(pushoverBuilder("Sending GIF from backyard").withApiKey("dsfhghj6546fghfg").withUser("qwerty54657").withDevice("Phone1").withAttachment("/tmpfs/DoorCam/ipcamera.gif"))
end
```

## MP4 Recordings

The binding can use FFmpeg to create a recording to a file.

To do this:

+ Consider setting the String channel that is called `mp4Filename` to a date and time stamp in a format that you like, or leave the channel empty for the filename to default to `ipcamera.mp4`.
+ Change the Number channel called `recordMp4` to a number of how many seconds that you wish to record for.
The recording will then start.
+ Once the file is created the channel `recordMp4` will change itself back to 0 which can be used to trigger a rule to send the file, or you could use this event to change a counter variable that is used in the filename to create `visitor1.mp4 visitor2.mp4`.
+ The channel `mp4History` keeps a string of the last 50 recording filenames (separated by commas) until you reset the history.
The channel mp4Filename is where this channel gets the names from when a recording is triggered.
+ The channel `mp4HistoryLength` keeps track of how many filenames are in the mp4History String.
You can send the `0` command to this channel to clear the mp4History string at the same time as setting this channel back to 0.
+ You can use the `FFMPEG_MP4_OUT_ARGUMENTS` config to apply any FFmpeg filters to the output file.

There is also a HABpanel Widget worth checking out as the thread has an example on how to use the bindings MP4 filename history feature to track the filenames of recent recordings.
<https://community.openhab.org/t/custom-widget-camera-history-and-live-popup/103082>

**NOTE:** If you are using a tmpfs folder, you will need to ensure you do not run out of space.
I use a rule to move the files out of the tmpfs as they are created.

*.items

```java
Switch BackyardCamExternalMotion "External Motion" { channel="ipcamera:HIKVISION:BackyardCam:externalMotion" }
String BackyardCamMp4Filename "Backyard MP4 Filename" { channel="ipcamera:HIKVISION:BackyardCam:mp4Filename" }
Number BackyardCamRecordMp4 "Backyard seconds to Record" { channel="ipcamera:HIKVISION:BackyardCam:recordMp4" }

```

*.rules

```java

rule "Record MP4 on External Zwave PIR"
    when
    Item BackyardCamExternalMotion changed to ON
    then
        BackyardCamMp4Filename.sendCommand( new DateTimeType().toString ) //create a file with the timestamp as the filename.
        BackyardCamRecordMp4.sendCommand(5) // record 5 seconds    
end

rule "Do something when recording finished"
    when
    Item BackyardCamRecordMp4 changed to 0
    then
    var TimeStamp = BackyardCamMp4Filename.state
    logInfo("camera.rules", "Mp4 recording "+ TimeStamp.toString +".mp4 is ready to be used.")
end

```

## HABpanel

This section is about how to get things working in HABpanel.

I highly recommend you check out the easy to use WIDGETS of which there are now 3 ready made ones that are discussed on the forum here.
<https://community.openhab.org/t/custom-widget-camera-clickable-thumbnails-that-open-a-stream/101275>

The widgets in the link above are the easiest way to get an advanced stream working in openHAB and you are welcome to open them up, look at how they work and change them to something even better that suits your needs.

## Group Displays

The [Full Example](#full-example) section shows how to setup a group display.

Some additional things to check to get it working are:

+ Currently the poll time of the group must be the same or less than the total time contained in each cameras m3u8 file.
If you have 3 seconds worth of video segments in the cameras HLS stream, this is the max time you can set to be the Poll time of the group to.
If your not using HLS and are just using ipcamera.jpg to display the groups picture, then the poll time can be set to a wider range.
+ All cameras should have the same HLS segment size setting, 1 and 2 second long segments have been tested to work.

This is still a very new feature and if you have any issues please send some TRACE level log output of when the problem occurs.

## Full Example

Use the following examples to base your setup on to save some time if you wish to use textual config.
Textual config should only be used by advanced users as the [Discovery](#discovery) method should be preferred by new users.

Replace AMCREST or HIKVISION with the name of the supported thing type you are using, as all cameras use consistent naming of channels and configs so changing between them is easy.

In the examples you will see the format is: `bindingID:thingType:UID` [param1="string",param2=x,param3=x]

bindingID: is always ipcamera.
thingType: is found listed above under [Supported Things](#supported-things).
UID: Can be made up but it must be UNIQUE, hence why it is called uniqueID. 

openHAB's discovery method will use the IP address with the dots removed as the UID.
By using textual config, you can name it something useful like "DrivewayCamera" if you wish, or stick with the same convention.
