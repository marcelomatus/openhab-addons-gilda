# MAX!CUL Binding

The aim of this binding is to allow the connection from openHAB to [eQ-3 MAX! Home Solution](http://www.eq-3.de/) devices (wall thermostat/radiator valves)
using the [CUL USB dongle](http://busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CUL) rather than the MAX!Cube.
This should allow greater control over the devices than the cube offers as all interaction is handled manually.

## Supported Things

This binding support 6 different things types

| Thing          | Type   | Description                                                                                                        |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cul_max_bridge | Bridge | CUL if using a serial CUL
| cun_max_bridge | Bridge | CUN if using a network CUL
| maxcul_bridge  | Bridge | This is the MAX! Cube emulation for the CUL.                                                                                 |
| thermostat     | Thing  | This is for the MAX! Heating Thermostat. This is also used for the power plug switch "Zwischenstecker-Schaltaktor". |
| thermostatplus | Thing  | This is for the MAX! Heating Thermostat+. This is the type that can hold the program by itself.                    |
| wallthermostat | Thing  | MAX! Wall Thermostat.                                                                                              |

| shuttercontact | Thing  | MAX! Shuttercontact / Window Contact.                                                                              |

Generally one does not have to worry about the thing types as they are automatically defined.
If for any reason you need to manually define the Things and you are not exactly sure what type of thermostat you have, you can choose `thermostat` for both the thermostat and thermostat+, this will not affect their working.

## Discovery

Start pairing at your MAX! device. It will show up in the inbox and you can it to your configuration. Serial number and rfAddress is set already
After adding too your configuration you have to set channel pair_mode to ON on your maxcul_bridge and restart
the pairing on your MAX! device to start the pairing sequence. 
If the device is already paired and starts re-pairing e.g. after battery change, the state of channel pair_mode is ignored.

## Binding Configuration

There are no binding wide settings as all configuration settings.
When using a serial port, you may need to add `-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyACM0` in your server startup.  Please consult the [forum](https://community.openhab.org) for the latest information.

## Status

The binding is currently in beta and it is recommended that you only use it expecting there to be bugs and issues. It is has enough features to be useful as a heating system, though lacks some of the finer features. This page will be updated as things progress.

## Tutorial

There was a tutorial using a Raspberry Pi with OH1 available at [technpol](https://technpol.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/configuration-of-maxcul-and-cul-dongle/), which addresses some of the configuration issues.

## Features

The binding currently offers the following features:

* Listen mode - this allows you to listen in on MAX! network activity from a MAX!Cube for example. A trace will be output in debug mode that decodes implemented messages
* Pairing - can pair devices with OpenHAB by triggering Pair Mode using a Switch item
* Wall Thermostat
* Can send set point temperature
* Can receive set point temperature
* Can receive measured temperature
* Can receive battery status
* Can receive operating mode
* Can factory reset device
* Can be configured to display current temperature or current setpoint (_likely 1.8.0+_)
* Radiator Thermostat Valve
* Can send set point temperature
* Can receive set point temperature
* Can receive measured temperature
* Can receive valve position
* Can receive battery status
* Can receive operating mode
* Can factory reset device
* Push Button
* Can receive either AUTO or ECO depending on button press (translated to ON/OFF)
* Can factory reset device
* Association
* It is possible to link devices together so that they communicate directly with each other, for example a wall thermostat and a radiator valve.
* TX Credit Monitoring

## Limitations

Aside from understanding what the binding does do which is documented here there are some key things to be aware of that may limit what you hope to achieve.

1. Radiator thermostat data is updated quite sporadically. Items such as set point temperature, measured temperature, valve position, battery status and operating mode are only sent when the state of the valve changes - i.e. valve moves or the dial used to manually set a temperature. If you want measured temperature it is much better to use a wall thermostat.
1. The binding has no concept of 'auto' mode: It currently has no ability to retrieve from any source and subsequently send a schedule to devices. This may change in the future, which would allow basic operation should OpenHAB fail for some reason.
1. If a wall thermostat is set to 'OFF' (mapped to 4.5deg) it won't update the measured temperature.

## Pairing

A device needs to be associated with the Max!CUL binding to work correctly. This is a simple process:

1. Ensure you have an item that has the correct device serial and settings you want configured in openhab
1. If you haven't already then create a seperate item and sitemap entry that is a switch that allows you to turn on pairing mode (NB. it will turn off automatically after 30s)
1. Switch on pairing mode
1. Once pairing mode is activated then you need to pair the device by pressing and holding the pairing button the device (see your device manual). You should see it start to count down a timer from 30. Once the pairing process has begun then you will see AC displayed (on Wall and Radiator thermostats at least) or for devices without a display the LED will flash as described in the manual.

**Please note:** If the device has been paired before you will need to factory reset it before use. Please see the device user manual for details on how to do this.

### Example Rule

demo.rules:

```java
rule "Reset MAX! Heating Thermostat to inital settings"
when
    ...
then
    val maxCubeActions = getActions("maxcul", "maxcul:thermostat:KEQ0565026")
    val Boolean success = maxCubeActions.reset()
    logInfo("max", "Action 'reset' returned '{}'", success)
end
```

## Technical Information

### Implemented Messages
The table below shows what messages are implemented and to what extent. Transmit means we can build and transmit a packet of that type with relevant data. Decode means we can extract data into some meaningful form. All message types can be received, identified and the raw payloads displayed. Messages not identified in this table cannot be transmitted by the binding and can only be decoded as a raw payload.

## Message Sequences

For situations such as the pairing where a whole sequences of messages is required the binding has implemented a message sequencing system. This allows the implementation of a state machine for the system to pass through as messages are passed back and forth.

This will be documented in more detail in due course.

## Planned Future Features

These are in no particular priority and are simply ideas. They may not get implemented at all.

1. If there is a pending SET_TEMPERATURE message in the queue and we receive a SET_TEMPERATURE from the thermostat we are waiting to send to then we should clear the message from the queue as it will be outdated.
1. Explore how to avoid the queue getting too long due to lack of credits with many devices.
1. Add ability to setup device groups which should help reduce lack of credit issue
