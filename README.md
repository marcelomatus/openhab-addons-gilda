## Zoneminder Binding

This binding offers integration to a ZoneMinder Server. It currently only offers to integrate to monitors (eg. cameras in ZoneMinder). It also only offers access to a limited set of values, as well as a even more limited option to update values in ZoneMinder. It requires at least ZoneMinder 1.29 with API enabled (option 'OPT_USE_API' in ZoneMinder must be enabled). The option 'OPT_TRIGGERS' must be anabled to allow OpenHAB to trip the ForceAlarm in ZoneMinder.
