# GPSTracker Binding

This binding allows you to connect mobile GPS tracking applications to an openHAB installation and detect 
presence based on GPS location reports. 
Currently two applications are supported:

* [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/booklet/) - iOS, Android
* [GPSLogger](https://gpslogger.app/) - Android

GPS location reports are sent to openHAB using HTTP protocol. 
Please be aware that this communication uses the public network so make sure your openHAB installation is [secured](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/security.html#encrypted-communication)
and you configured HTTP**S** access in tracking applications.

The binding can process two message types received from trackers:

* **Location** - This is a simple location report with coordinates extended with some extra information about the tracker (e.g. tracker device battery level). [OwnTracks, GPSLogger]
* **Transition** - This report is based on regions defined in tracker application. A message is sent every time the tracker enters or leaves a region. [OwnTracks only]

## Regions

Regions are predefined waypoints with a center location and a radius. 
The binding defines two region types:

* **External** - region is defined in tracker application. 
These regions are usually user specific (e.g. family members can have their own waypoints like school or work) and the tracker is responsible to send transition messages related to external regions. [supported by OwnTracks]
* **Internal** - defined centrally in the binding config which regions are shared between all users connected to the openHAB installation. For these regions it is the binding's responsibility to fire the entering or leaving events (the distance of the tracker is calculated after each location report). The best example for this region type is Home. The openHAB installation location can be set on **System/Regional Settings** configuration screen. This location is interpreted by the binding as the **primary region**. [supported by both OwnTracks and GPSLogger]

## Configuration

### Binding in openHAB

After installing the binding the main configuration task is to define the **Internal** regions. 
There is one primary region which is the location of the openHAB installation.
Details for the primary region can be defined on binding's configuration dialog while additional internal regions can be defined in advanced JSON field.

Parameter | Type | Description | Default value
:--- |:---|:---|:---
Name | String | Region name
Location | Location | Region center defined by System/Regional Settings |
Radius | Integer | Radius of the region circle in meters. The value should be set based on the tracker application used and its settings (location update interval and displacement) | 100m
Additional region definitions | JSON String | 

Example for additional region definition (parameters are the same as for the primary region above):

 ```
 [
    {
        "name": "ExtraRegion1",
        "location": "xx.xxxx,yy.yyyy",
        "radius": 100
    },
    {
        "name": "ExtraRegion2",
        "location": "xx.xxxx,yy.yyyy",
        "radius": 100
    },
    ...
 ]
 ```

### OwnTracks

Install [OwnTracks for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid) or [OwnTracks for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/owntracks/id692424691) on your device.

Go to Preferences/Connection and set:

* **Mode** - select Private HTTP
* **Host** - **https://<your.ip.address>/gpstracker/owntracks**
* **Identification**
  * Turn Authentication ON
  * Set username and password to be able to reach your openHAB server
  * Device ID is not important. Set it to e.g. phone
  * Tracker ID - This id identifies the tracker as a thing. I use initials here.

### GPSLogger

Install [GPSLogger for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger) on your device. 
After the launch, go to General Options. 
Enable Start on bootup and Start on app launch.

![Image](./docs/gpslogger_1.png)

Go to Logging details and disable Log to GPX, Log to KML and Log to NMEA. 
Enable Log to custom URL.

![Image](./docs/gpslogger_2.png)

Right after enabling, the app takes you to the Log to custom URL settings and modify:

* **URL** - Set URL to **https://<username>:<password>@<your.ip.address>/gpstracker/gpslogger** by replacing <???> with values matching your setup. Itâ€™s HIGHLY recommended to use SSL/TLS.
* **HTTP Body** - Type in the following JSON:

```
{
    "_type":"location",
    "lat":%LAT,
    "lon":%LON,
    "tid":"XY",
    "acc":%ACC,
    "batt":%BATT,
    "tst":%TIMESTAMP
}
```

**Note**: The value of "tid" is the tracker id that identifies the tracker as a thing in openHAB. 
This must be unique for each tracker connected to the same openHAB instance (e.g. family members).

* **HTTP Method** - type in: **POST**
* **HTTP Headers** - type in: **Content-Type: application/json**

### Things

It is possible to define things manually or to use the discovery feature of the openHAB. 
An important detail for both methods is that a tracker is identified by a **tracker id** configured on mobile devices. 
Make sure these tracker ids are unique in group of trackers connected to a single openHAB instance.

#### Manual setup

```
//phones
Thing gpstracker:tracker:1   "XY tracker" [trackerId="XY"]
Thing gpstracker:tracker:2   "PQ tracker" [trackerId="PQ"]
...
```

#### Discovery

If the things are not defined in **.things** files the first time the tracker sends a GPS log record the binding recognizes it as new tracker and inserts an entry into the Inbox as new tracker with name **GPS Tracker ??**.

### Channels

The binding creates dynamic channels based on the configuration for internal regions only:

* **Region presence channels** - ON state of the switch channels indicate the presence within region radius. Dynamic channel id format for these channels is **regionPresence_%regionId%**.
* **Distance** - Distance from region center is calculated after every location report received. Dynamic channel id format for these channels is **distance_%regionId%**.

Static channels provided by the tracker things:

* **Location** - Current location of the tracker
* **Last Report** - Timestamp of the last location report
* **Battery Level** - Battery level of the device running the tracker application
* **Region trigger channel** - Used by external regions only. Event is fired with payload of the region name when the binding receives a **transition** log record. Payload is prefixed with `>` for entering and with `<` for leaving events.

```
Number		distanceEX	"Distance [%.2f km]"	{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:distance"}
Switch		atWorkEX	"EX @ Work"		{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:regionPresence_Work"}
Switch		atHomeEX	"EX @ Home"		{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:regionPresence_Home"}
Location	locationEX	"Location"		{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:location"}
DateTime	lastSeenEX	"Last seen"		{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:lastReport"}
Number		batteryEX	"Battery level"		{channel="gpstracker:tracker:1:batteryLevel"}
```
