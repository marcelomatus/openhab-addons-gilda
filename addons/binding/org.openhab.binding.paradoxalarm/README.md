# Paradox Alarm System binding

This binding is intended to provide basic support for Paradox Alarm system.<br>
With the power of OpenHab this binding can be used for complex decision rules combining motion/magnetic sensor or whole partitions states with different scenarios. <br>
Examples: All partitions are armed, therefore there is no one at home. Window is opened for more than 10 minutes and temperature outside is bellow XXX degrees, send mail/any other supported notification to particular people.

## Supported Paradox panels/systems
Currently binding supports the following panels: EVO192, EVO48(not tested), EVO96(not tested)

## Supported things and bridges

The binding supports the following things:

###Bridge
**ip150** - the bridge is used to communicate with IP150 ethernet module attached to Paradox security system.
Supported commands: LOGOUT, LOGIN, RESET

###Things
**panel** - this is representation of Paradox panel. Has the general information about the main panel module, i.e. serial number, firmware/hardware/software versions, panel type, etc...<br>
**partition** - representation of Paradox partition - currently provides "state"(armed, disarmed, in alarm), partition label and in channel additional states are aggregated additional states which are booleans (ready to arm, trouble, force instant arm ready, etc...)<br>
**zone** - Paradox zone. Can be anything - magnetic, motion or any other opened/closed sensor. State channel is contact, low battery and is tampered channels are boolean, label is String<br>

### IP150 bridge configuration

#### Parameters:

**refresh** - value is in seconds. Defines the refresh interval when the binding polls from paradox system.<br>
**ip150Password** - pretty obvious. The password to your IP150 (not your panel PIN).<br>
**pcPassword** - The code 3012 setting. Default value is 0000 for Paradox<br>
**ipAddress** - pretty obvious. IP address of your IP150<br>
**port** - the port used for data communication. Default is 10000 for Paradox<br>
**panelType** - not mandatory. Will be used if discovery does not identify the panel.

#### Channels:

**communicationCommand** - Possible values [LOGOUT, LOGIN, RESET]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOGOUT: logs out and disconnects from Paradox alarm system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOGIN: creates socket if necessary, connects to paradox system and uses the logon data from the thing parameters to connect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESET: does logout and then login with recreation of communicator objects inside the code.<br>

### Entities configuration parameters:

**id** - the numeric ID of the zone/partition<br>


### Example things configuration

```java
   Bridge paradoxalarm:ip150:ip150 [refresh=5, panelType=“EVO192”, ip150Password=“asdfasdf”, pcPassword=“1234”, ipAddress=“192.168.100.100”, port=10000 ] {

        Thing panel panel

        Thing partition partition1 [id=1]
        Thing partition partition2 [id=2]
        Thing partition partition3 [id=3]
        Thing partition partition4 [id=4]

        Thing zone MotionSensor1 [id=1]
        Thing zone MagneticSensorWindow1 [id=2]
        Thing zone MotionSensor2 [id=3]
        Thing zone MagneticSensorWindow2 [id=4]
}
```
