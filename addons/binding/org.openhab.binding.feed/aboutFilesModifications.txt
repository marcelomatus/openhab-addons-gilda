about.html files modified
Eclipse foundation changed to openHab community

Files, which were not modified, because they contained only third party information about the licences:
openhab2-addons/addons/voice/org.openhab.voice.marytts/about.html
openhab2-addons/addons/voice/org.openhab.voice.kaldi/about.html
openhab2-addons/addons/io/org.openhab.io.homekit/about.html
PS: I was thinking of adding licence information to these files, but they are missing dates. The other about.html files all have something like <p>&lt;<em>April 22, 2016</em>&gt;</p>.
