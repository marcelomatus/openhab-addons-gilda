# ZigBee Binding
The ZigBee binding supports an interface to a wireless ZigBee home automation network. 


## Supported Things

### ZigBee TI2531 Coordinator

Before the binding can be used, a coordinator must be added. This needs to be done manually and the serial port must be set.


## Discovery

Once the binding is authorized, and an adapter is added, it automatically reads all devices that are set up on the ZigBee controller and puts them in the Inbox.
