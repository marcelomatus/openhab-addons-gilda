# Amazon Dash Button Binding

The Amazon Dash Button is a very cheap device in order to integrate it in your home automation setup. In openHAB it can be used as a simple switch.

## Prerequisites
The binding uses pcap4j (https://www.pcap4j.org/) in order to capture ARP requests send by the Amazon Dash Button. The code is inspired by https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button.


### Install Native Library
Letâ€™s start with installing libpcap (for Mac/Linux/UNIX) or WinPcap (for Windows) on your computer. They are native libraries that powers the core functionalities of Pcap4J.
#### Ubuntu
```
apt-get install libpcap-dev
```
#### CentOs
```
yum install libpcap-devel
```
#### Mac
```
brew install libpcap
```

#### Windows
```
choco install winpcap
```

Just follow the instructions to set it up in their mobile app. When you get to the step where it asks you to pick which product you want to map it to, just quit the setup process.

### Block Internet access for the Dash Button
Completely deny internet access for the Amazaon Dash Button in your router. You need to find out the Dash button's IP address first of all. This is not explained as this job depends on your environment.
