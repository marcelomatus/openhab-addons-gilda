# Nanoleaf Binding

This binding integrates the [Nanoleaf Light Panels](https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/smarter-series/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit/). 

![Image](doc/Nanoleaf.jpg)

It enables you to authenticate, control, and obtain information of a Light Panels device. The binding uses the [Nanoleaf OpenAPI](http://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs/openapi), which requires firmware version [1.5.0](https://helpdesk.nanoleaf.me/hc/en-us/articles/214006129-Light-Panels-Firmware-Release-Notes) or higher.

## Supported Things

The binding supports two thing types: controller and lightpanel.

The controller thing is the bridge for the individual panels connected to it. With the controller thing you can control channels which affect all panels, e.g. selecting effects or setting the brightness. 

The lightpanel things control the individual panels. You can set the color for each panel or turn it on (white) or off (black). 

## Discovery

A controller (bridge) device is discovered automatically through mDNS in the local network. Alternatively, you can also provide a things file (see below for more details). After the device is discovered and added as a thing, it needs a valid authentication token that must be obtained by pairing it with your openHAB instance. Without the token the light panels remain in status OFFLINE.

The binding supports pairing of the device with your openHAB instance as follows:

1. Make sure that the authentication token field in your Nanoleaf controller thing configuration is left empty.
2. Hold down the on-off button of the controller for 5-7 seconds until the LED starts flashing in a pattern. This turns the device in pairing mode, and openHAB will try to request an authentication token for it.

Once your openHAB instance successfully requested and stored the authentication token in the thing configuration, the controller status changes to ONLINE, and you can start linking the channels to your items.

For a paired controller, discovery of the individual panels connected to it can be activated. By default, it is turned off. To turn it on, go to Paper UI, select the controller thing, open the configuration settings and turn "Discover Panels" switch on. All connected panels will be added a separate things to the inbox. Afterwards, you can turn "Discover Panels" configuration off.

## Thing Configuration

The controller thing has the following parameters:

| Config          | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address         | IP address or hostname of the light panels controller (e.g. 192.168.1.100)            |
| port            | Port number of the light panels contoller. Default is 16021                           |
| authToken       | The authentication token received from the controller after successful pairing.       |
| refreshInterval | Interval in seconds to refresh the state of the light panels settings. Default is 60. |
| discoverPanels  | Enables or disables discovery of the connected panels as things of type lightpanel    |

The lightpanel thing has the following parameters:

| Config          | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id              | ID assigned by the controller to the individual panel (e.g. 158)                      |

The IDs of the individual panels can be determined by switching the discoverPanels configuration to ON for the controller. This will add all panels with their IDs to the inbox.

## Channels

The controller bridge has the following channels:

| Channel             | Item Type | Description                                                            | Read Only |

| hue                 | Number    | Hue of all light panels (0 to 360)                                     | No        |

| colorTemperature    | Number    | Color temperature (in Kelvin, 1200 to 6500) of all light panels        | No        |

| rhythmActive        | Switch    | Activity state of the rhythm module                                    | Yes       |
| rhythmMode          | Number    | Sound source for the rhythm module. 1=Microphone, 2=Aux cable          | No        |

A lightpanel thing has the following channels:

| Channel             | Item Type | Description                                                            | Read Only |
