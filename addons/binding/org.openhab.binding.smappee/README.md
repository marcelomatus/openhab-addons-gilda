# Smappee Binding

This binding integrates the [Smappee energy monitor](http://www.smappee.com/be_en/home).

## Introduction

Thanks to the Smappee energy monitor you always know how much power your appliances consume, wherever you are. For more comfort, a better insight and sustainable energy savings up to 30%.

Both the Energy monitor and the Solar energy monitor can be used. These can be bought online in the [smappee webshop] (http://www.smappee.com/be_en/eshop/monitors.html).

The smappee supports clamps for 3 phase and 1 phase systems and there is a separate circuit clamp for your solar system. installation manuals can be found on [their support page](https://www.smappee.com/be_en/support)

## Supported Things

This binding provides 1 bridge thing type : 'smappee'. There should be only 1 smappee device installed in your home.
This thing act like a bridge and represents your smappee monitor device and should be configured first. Once configured, this will autodetect all other smappee things.
Detected things :

- appliance: A detected appliance, the appliances that are not categorized yet (type "Find Me"), are skipped. 
- actuator: A paired smappee switch.
- sensor: A paired water or gas sensor.

## Discovery

The smappee thing must be configured manually. Appliances, Actuators and the sensors are auto-detected. 

## Smappee thing configuration

As described on their [support page] (https://support.smappee.com/hc/en-us/articles/202153935-Where-can-I-find-the-API-documentation-), you need to email [support@smappee.com] (mailto:support@smappee.com) to get a client ID and a client secret to access the api.

## Full Example

A manual setup through a `things/smappee.things` file could look like this:

```
Bridge smappee:monitor:mySmappee "Smappee" @ "Living Room" [clientId="xxx", clientSecret="xxx", username="xxx", password="xxx", serviceLocationName="xxx", poll_time=5]
{
    Thing smappee:appliance:myAppliance [ id="xxx", type="Blinds" ]
    Thing smappee:actuator:myPlug [ id="xxx" ]
    Thing smappee:sensor:mySensor [ id="xxx" ]
}
```

A manual configuration through a `demo.items` file could look like this:

```
Number mySmappee_Consumption     "Consumption [%s]"      { channel="smappee:monitor:mySmappee:monitor-consumption-channel" }
Number mySmappee_Solar           "Solar [%s]"            { channel="smappee:monitor:mySmappee:monitor-solar-channel" } 
Number mySmappee_AlwaysOn        "Always On [%s]"        { channel="smappee:monitor:mySmappee:monitor-alwayson-channel" }

Number mySmappee_AppliancePower  "Appliance Power [%s]"  { channel="smappee:appliance:myAppliance:appliance-power" }
```

The sitemap could look like this:

```
sitemap home label="My home" {
    Frame label="Energy" {
        Text item=mySmappee_Consumption label="Consumption [%s]" icon="energy"
        Text item=mySmappee_Solar label="Solar [%s]" icon="sun"
        Text item=mySmappee_AlwaysOn label="Always On [%s]" icon="energy"
    }
}
```
