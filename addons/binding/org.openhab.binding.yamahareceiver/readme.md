# Yamahareceiver Binding

This binding connects openhab with Yamaha Receivers of product line CX-A5000, RX-A30xx, RX-A20xx, RX-A10xx, RX-Vxxx, RX-Z7, DSP-Z7, RX-S600, HTR-xxxx.
If your hardware is on the list but still does not work, please fill a bug report!

## Configuration

Just use the auto discovery feature or add a thing for the binding manually
by providing host and port.
Initially a thing for the main zone will be created. This will trigger a zone
detection internally and all available additional zones will appear as new things.

## Features
The implemented channels are so far:

* `power`: Openhab Type `Switch`, Switches The Receiver ON or OFF. Your receiver has to be in network standby for this to work.
* `mute`: Openhab Type `Switch`, Mute or Unmute the receiver.
* `volume`: Openhab Type `Dimmer`, Set's the receivers Volume percent Value.
* `input`: Openhab Type `String`, Set's the input selection, depends on your receiver's real inputs. Examples: HDMI1, HDMI2, AV4, TUNER, NET RADIO, etc. Those names can be changed on the receiver. A list of available inputs is fetched internally, but there is now way to make that available to sitemaps at the moment.
* `surroundProgram`: Openhab Type `String`, Set's the surround Mode. Examples: 2ch Stereo, 7ch Stereo, Hall in Munic, Straight, Surround Decoder. A list of available modes is already defined but is not available for sitemaps at the moment due to openhab2 limitations.
 
## Example

     # For auto linking with PaperUI.
     # Link the items to the channels of your prefered zone in paperui after you've saved
     # your items file.

	 # Although mappings/options are already defined for the channels, they are not shown in the current version of openhab2.
	 # For the moment, just define mappings in your sitemap files.

Hint: The tricky thing are the `"` around `NET RADIO`, this Key (left from the equal sign) is a value that must be send to the receiver **with** the space inside. If you omit the `"` the binding sends only the `NET` and the receiver does nothing. Same are in surround definition!
