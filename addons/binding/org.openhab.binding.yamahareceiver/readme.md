# Yamaha Receiver Binding

This binding connects openHAB with Yamaha Receivers of product line CX-A5000, RX-A30xx, RX-A20xx, RX-A10xx, RX-Vxxx, RX-Z7, DSP-Z7, RX-S600, HTR-xxxx.
If your hardware is on the list but still does not work, please fill a bug report!

## Configuration

Just use the auto discovery feature or add a thing for the binding manually
by providing host and port.
Initially a thing for the main zone will be created. This will trigger a zone
detection internally and all available additional zones will appear as new things.

## Features
The implemented channels are so far:

* `power`: openHAB type `Switch`, switches the receiver _ON_ or _OFF_. Your receiver has to be in network standby for this to work.
* `mute`: openHAB type `Switch`, mutes or unmutes the receiver.
* `volume`: openHAB type `Dimmer`, sets the receiver's volume as percent value.
* `input`: openHAB type `String`, sets the input selection, depends on your receiver's real inputs. Examples: _HDMI1_, _HDMI2_, _AV4_, _TUNER_, _NET RADIO_, etc. Those names can be changed on the receiver but you always have to use the real names. A list of available inputs is fetched internally, but there is now way to make that available to sitemaps at the moment.
* `surroundProgram`: openHAB type `String`, sets the surround mode, examples: _2ch Stereo_, _7ch Stereo_, _Hall in Munich, _Straight_, _Surround Decoder_. A list of available modes is already defined but is not available for sitemaps at the moment due to openHAB2 limitations.
* `netradiotune`: openHAB type `Number`, selects a net radio channel.
* `netradiostation`: openHAB type `String` (read-only), display the name currently active net radio station.
* `netradiosong`: openHAB type `String` (read-only), display the name of the song played on the active net radio station. 
 
## Example

     # For auto linking with PaperUI.
     # Link the items to the channels of your prefered zone in paperui after you've saved
     # your items file.

**Hint:** Very important are the quotes (`"`) around `NET RADIO` left ot the equal sign. This key is a value that must be send to the receiver **with** the space inside. If you omit the `"`, the binding sends only the `NET` and the receiver does nothing. The same applies to the surround definition.
