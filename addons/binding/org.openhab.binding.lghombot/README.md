# LG HomBot Binding

The binding integrates hacked LG HomBot VR6260 based vacuum robots.
Details on how to modify your HomBot can be [found here](https://www.roboter-forum.com/index.php?thread/10009-lg-hombot-3-0-wlan-kamera-steuerung-per-weboberfl√§che/).
The binding uses the HTTP service on port 6260 right now.

## Supported Things

### Hacked LG HomBot series 62XX are supported.
The service that the binding connects to is actually lg.srv [found here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lgsrv/) running on a HomBot.

## Discovery

The auto-discovery should hopefully find your HomBot, be aware that it will try to connect to port 6260 on all IP-addresses on your subnet.
If you already know the IP-address of your HomBot you might as well just plug it in.

## Thing Configuration

The binding only requires an IP-address to function, this should hopefully be found using the discovery method.
