# XMPPClient Binding

XMPPClient binding provides support for sending and receiving XMPP (Jabber) messages.

## Supported Things



## Thing Configuration

_Describe what is needed to manually configure a thing, either through the (Paper) UI or via a thing-file. This should be mainly about its mandatory and optional configuration parameters. A short example entry for a thing file can help!_

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Channels

_Here you should provide information about available channel types, what their meaning is and how they can be used._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Full Example

_Provide a full usage example based on textual configuration files (*.things, *.items, *.sitemap)._

## Example Rules

_Feel free to add additional sections for whatever you think should also be mentioned about your binding!_
