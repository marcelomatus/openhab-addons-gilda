# Kodi Binding

This binding integrates the Kodi players (which used to be XBMC).

## Introduction

This binding allows to control a kodi media player instance. In order to allow this binding to control kodi, you need to enable "remote control form applications" in your kodi application. (Settings -> Service Settings -> Control -> Allow remote control from applications on other systems)

## Supported Things

This binding supports only one thing: The Kodi player. All kodi devices are registered as an audio sink in the framework.


## Discovery

The binding can auto-discover the Kodi players present on your local network. The auto-discovery is enabled by default. To disable it, you can add the following line to conf/services/runtime.cfg:

```
org.openhab.kodi:enableAutoDiscovery=false
```

## Binding Configuration


This configuration parameter only controls the Kodi player auto-discovery process, not the openHAB auto-discovery. Moreover, if the openHAB auto-discovery is disabled, the Kodi player auto-discovery is disabled too.

The binding has the following configuration option, which can be set for "binding:kodi":

| Parameter | Name    | Description  | Required |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|------------ |
| callbackUrl | Callback URL | URL to use for playing notification sounds, e.g. http://192.168.0.2:8080 | no |


## Thing Configuration

The Kodi player thing requires the ip address and the port to access it on. 
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like

```
Kodi:Kodi:myKodi [ipAddress="192.168.1.100", port="9090"]
```

## Channels

The Kodi thing supports the following channels:
