# Camera Binding

The binding integrates simple IP base cameras.  

Almost every IP camera has a simple HTTP access API defined by Urls to access at least static images.
Additionally video streams like H264.x oder MJPEG and others are very wide spread. This binding supports these types of cameras.

## Near Future

* Motion detection
* PTZ Url support
* Timeline persistence
* ONVIF detection

## Far Future

* Video support
* Video archiving

## Ideas (welcome)

* Instead of polling for images via the backend applets or more intelligent viewers might integrated into the UI.
* Prefetch
