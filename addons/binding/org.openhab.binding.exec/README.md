# Exec Binding

This binding integrates the possibility to execute arbitrary shell commands.

## Supported Things

Currently, the binding supports a single type of Thing, being the `command` Thing.

## Binding Configuration

The binding does not require any specific configuration.

Note that on Unix systems the commands are executed in the context and with the privileges of the process running the java virtual machine, and it is not advised to run the virtual machine as superuser/root. It is advised to test the execution of the command in a shell using the user owning the JVM process, for example

```
sudo -u openhab <command>
```

The execution of the commands is triggered by either sending a Command or State Update to the input Channel of the `command` Thing, if configured so, or by sending the ON Command to the run Channel of the `command` Thing (see below)

## Thing Configuration

The `command` Thing requires the following mandatory configuration parameters:

- [command] the command to execute on the shell. 

Optionally one can specify:

- [transform] a transformation to apply on the execution result
- [interval] an interval, in seconds, the [command] will be repeatedly executed. Default is 60 seconds, set to 0 to avoid repetition
- [timeout] a time-out, in seconds, after which the execution of the [command] will time out
- [runOnInput] a boolean parameter to make the [command] execute immediately every time a Command or a State Update is sent to the input channel of the `command` Thing, and lastly
- [repeatEnabled] a boolean parameter to allow the [command] to be executed repeatedly, e.g. when the same Command or State Update is sent to input channel repeatedly. This parameter only makes sense when used in combination with [runOnInput] set to true

For each [command] a separate Thing has to be defined. For example,

```
Thing exec:command:apc [command="/usr/local/bin/apcaccess  status", interval=15, timeout=5, runOnInput=true, repeatEnabled=true]
```

[command] itself can be enhanced using some specific qualifiers that will be substituted by actual values at runtime. The qualifiers have the following syntax:

`${<key>:<transform>:<formatter>}`

whereby 

- <key> can be either
     - the name of an Item
     - `exec-input`, denoting the current State of the input Channel of the `command` Thing
     - `exec-time`, denoting the current date (as java.util.Date)     
- <transform> is any valid [Transformation](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/transformations.html) service expression, e.g. REGEX((.*?)). <transform> is mandatory for the `exec-time` key
- <formatter> is a formatting string using the well known syntax of the [java.util.Formatter](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax) class

At runtime the binding will grab the value of the <key>, transform it with the <transform> expression, and finally format the transformation result using the <formatter> format. For example,

```
Thing exec:command:lightcontroller [command="/usr/local/bin/light.sh  ${lightSwitch:MAP(en.map):%1$s}"]
```

When the [command] of the lightcontroller item is executed then the value of the lightSwitch Item is retrieved, transformed using the en.map MAP Transform, and passed on as a literal string (i.e. %1$s takes the first argument of the result of the Transform, and formats it as a String) to the ligh.sh script

Nesting of substitution keys is supported, e.g. `${lightSwitch_${lightCounter}}` will resolve the lightCounter Item first, and then subsequently resolve the second substitution key. For example, if the value of lighCounter would happen to be 3, then the second substitution resolved to the value of Item `lighSwitch_3`

```
Thing exec:command:lightcontroller [command="/usr/local/bin/light.sh  ${exec-input}"]
```

In the above example, exec-input is substituted with the actual State of the input Channel of the `exec:command:lightcontroller` Thing

The Channels themselves are defined as custom State Channels (https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/blob/master/docs/documentation/features/dsl.md#defining-channels), so one can freely define the Type of each Channel. The `command` Thing supports both an `input` and `output` Channel to set an input for the [command] and get the output of the command execution.

## Channels

All Things support the following channels:

| Channel Type ID | Item Type    | Description                               |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| input           | custom       | Input parameter to provide to the command |
| output          | custom       | Output of the last execution of the command |
| exit            | Number       | The exit value of the last execution of the command |
| run             | Switch       | Send ON to execute the command. the current State of this channel tells whether the command is running or not |
| lastexecution   | DateTime     | Time/Date the command was last executed, in yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ format |

```

```

**demo.rules**

```

  when
     Item someTrigger changed
  then
        // set the additional command line arguments to the switch_control.sh script
        if(YourTrigger.state == ON){
                LampSwitch.sendCommand(ON)
        }else{
                LampSwitch.sendCommand(OFF)
        }

      // Trigger execution
      LampSwitching.sendCommand(ON)

      // wait for the command to complete
      // State will be NULL if not used before or ON while command is executed
      while(LampSwitching.state != OFF){
         Thread::sleep(500)
      }
      
      // Logging of command line result
      logInfo("Switching the lamp", "Result:" + LampResult.state )
      
      // If the returned string is just a number it can be parsed
      // If not a transformation service can be used
      YourNumber.postUpdate(
            (Integer::parseInt(LampResult.state.toString) as Number )
      )
end
